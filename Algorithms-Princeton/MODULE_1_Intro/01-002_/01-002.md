## Why Study Algorithms?

### 1. Broad and Far-Reaching Impact

Algorithms have revolutionised multiple fields:

* **Internet**: Web search, packet routing, distributed file sharing
* **Biology**: Human genome project, protein folding
* **Computers**: Circuit layout, file system, compilers
* **Computer graphics**: Movies, video games, virtual reality
* **Security**: Cell phones, e-commerce, voting machines
* **Multimedia**: MP3, JPG, DivX, HDTV, face recognition
* **Social networks**: Recommendations, news feeds, advertisements
* **Physics**: N-body simulation, particle collision simulation

### 2. Old Roots, New Opportunities

**Historical timeline**:

* **300 BCE**: Study of algorithms dates to Euclid
* **1920s-1930s**: Formalised by Church and Turing
* **20th century**: Extraordinary advancement in algorithmic discovery
* **Modern era**: Algorithms remain at the forefront of computational innovation

**Important note**: Some groundbreaking algorithms have been discovered by undergraduate students in courses like this.

### 3. To Solve Seemingly Intractable Problems

Certain problems cannot be addressed without algorithmic innovation.

_Example: Network connectivity_ \[explored in this course]

### 4. For Intellectual Stimulation

> "For me, great algorithms are the poetry of computation. Just like verse, they can be terse, allusive, dense, and even mysterious. But once unlocked, they cast a brilliant new light on some aspect of computing." — Francis Sullivan

> "An algorithm must be seen to be believed." — Donald Knuth

### 5. To Become a Proficient Programmer

> "I will, in fact, claim that the difference between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he considers his code or his data structures more important. Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships." — Linus Torvalds (creator of Linux)

> "Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs." — Niklaus Wirth

### 6. They May Unlock the Secrets of Life and the Universe

**Computational paradigm shift**:

**20th Century Science** (formula-based):

* E = mc²
* F = ma
* F = Gm₁m₂/r²
* Schrödinger equation

**21st Century Science** (algorithm-based):

```java
for (double t = 0.0; true; t = t + dt)
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    bodies[i].resetForce();
    for (int j = 0; j < N; j++)
      if (i != j)
        bodies[i].addForce(bodies[j]);
  }
```

Computational models increasingly replace mathematical models in scientific inquiry.

> "Algorithms: a common language for nature, human, and computer." — Avi Wigderson

### 7. For Fun and Profit

## Historical Context: The Joy of Algorithms

_From Computing in Science & Engineering_

**Computational algorithms are ancient**: Sumerian cuneiform (one of humanity's most ancient written records) contains algorithm descriptions for base-60 reckoning. Even Stonehenge may embody the Druid algorithm for estimating summer's start.

### Algorithm Impact

Algorithms have been **essential for progress** in:

* Communications
* Healthcare
* Manufacturing
* Economics
* Weather prediction
* Defence
* Fundamental science

**Bidirectional relationship**: Progress in these areas stimulates search for even better algorithms.

### Moore's Law vs. Algorithmic Innovation

Moore's Law provides a factor-of-two performance increase every 18 months, effectively changing the **constant** in algorithmic running time.

**Important new algorithms** do not arrive every 1.5 years, but when they do, they can **change the exponent of complexity**—a far more significant improvement than hardware advances alone.

### Contemporary Challenges

**Remaining unsolved problems**:

* **Data extraction from massive datasets**: Largely untouched despite considerable effort
* **Large-scale floating-point verification**: Need efficient methods analogous to checksums for multidisciplinary optimisations
* **NP-complete problems**: Instances arise frequently in practical applications; efficient attack methods remain elusive
* **Quantum computing and random number generation**: May require fundamental reconsideration of computational theory, logic, and the nature of the physical world

**Outlook**: The 21st century promises another revolution in computational theory foundations, neither restful nor dull.
