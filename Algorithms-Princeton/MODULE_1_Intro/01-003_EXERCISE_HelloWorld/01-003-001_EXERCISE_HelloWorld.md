# 01-003-001: Practice Programming Assignment - Hello, World

## Instructions

This assignment is **optional**. Its main purpose is to ensure that you can **write simple Java programmes**, **use algs4.jar**, and **submit the assignment**.

---

## Specification

Here is the **programming assignment specification** that describes the assignment requirements.

Be sure that your code conforms to the **prescribed APIs**: 

- Each programme must be in the **"default" package** (i.e., no `package` statements)
- Include **only the public methods and constructors** specified (extra private methods are fine)
- Note that `algs4.jar` uses a **"named" package**, so you must use an **import statement** to access a class in `algs4.jar`

## Web Submission

Submit a **zip file** named **`hello.zip`** that contains **only the three source files**:
- `HelloWorld.java`
- `HelloGoodbye.java`
- `RandomWord.java`
