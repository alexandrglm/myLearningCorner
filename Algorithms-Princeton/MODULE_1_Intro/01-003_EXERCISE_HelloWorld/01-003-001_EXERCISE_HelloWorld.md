Practice Programming Assignment: Hello, World

## INSTRUCTIONS

This assignment is optional. Its main purpose is to ensure that you can write simple Java programs; use algs4.jar; and submit the assignment.
Specification

Here is the programming assignment specification

 that describes the assignment requirements.

Be sure that your code conforms to the prescribed APIs: each program must be in the "default" package (i.e., no package statements) and include only the public methods and constructors specified (extra private methods are fine). Note that algs4.jar uses a "named" package, so you must use an import statement to access a class in algs4.jar.
Web Submission

Submit a zip file named hello.zip that contains only the three source files HelloWorld.java, HelloGoodbye.java, and RandomWord.java.
Assessment Report

See the Assessment Guide
 for details on how to interpret the assessment report. 
 
 How to submit

When you're ready to submit, you can upload files for each part of the assignment on the "My submissions" tab.
