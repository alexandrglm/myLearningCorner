# 02-001:  Union-Find and Algorithm Analysis

## Lecture 1: Union-Find

**Topic**: Dynamic connectivity problem and union-find data type.

**Learning outcomes**:
- Illustrate the basic approach to developing and analysing algorithms
- Introduce the **union-find data type**
- Consider several implementations:
  - **Quick find**
  - **Quick union**
  - **Weighted quick union**
  - **Weighted quick union with path compression**
- Apply the union-find data type to the **percolation problem** from physical chemistry

## Lecture 2: Analysis of Algorithms

**Topic**: **Scientific method** for rigorous analysing algorithm performance.

**Learning outcomes**:
- Perform computational experiments to measure programme running times
- Develop hypotheses about performance based on empirical measurements
- Create mathematical models to explain algorithm behaviour
- Analyse memory usage of Java programmes

## Programming Assignment: Percolation

**Objective**: Apply union-find concepts to a fundamental problem in physical chemistry.

**Significance**: This is the **first of many examples** demonstrating how a good algorithm—in this case, **weighted quick union**—determines whether a problem can be efficiently solved or remains computationally intractable.

**Key insight**: Algorithmic efficiency transforms computational problems from unsolvable to practical.
