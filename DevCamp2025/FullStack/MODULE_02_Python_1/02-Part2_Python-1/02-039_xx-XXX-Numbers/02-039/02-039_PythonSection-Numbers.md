# Module 02 - 039 . Python -> Numbers

Continuing on our journey through the python data types; in the last 
section we walk through how to work with the string data type and in 
this section we're going to dive into the number data type.

Now, **one of the biggest reasons why Python has become so widely accepted in the scientific community and in the data science and machine learning communities** is because **it works with numbers very well**.    

 There is a very wide assortment of math and science libraries that you can tie directly into the language and in the latter part of the section, we're also going to do that.  

But we're going to start out with the basics.

* We're going to see all of the various operators that you can use. 

* We're going to walk through how python actually looks at a mathematical program and a formula and then the order of operations that it follows.   

* And we're going to take that all the way through in using some powerful math libraries.
