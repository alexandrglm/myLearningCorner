# MODULE 01: 006 🤔 **Is Writing Bad Code Immoral for Developers?**

This guide discusses a slightly odd question: 

	>“Is writing bad code immoral?”*
 
It leads us to the concept of the importance of developing **well-written code**.
---

## But ..🧐 the question stills overwhelm: *Is Writing Bad Code Immoral?*

This may seem like a weird question to ask because the mindset of most developers is that code projects are neither **moral** nor **immoral**.  
They are simply **programming files** that perform various functionalities.  

I would like to think that most developers take pride in their work and therefore want to write code that adheres to **best practices**.  
However, given **schedule** and **budget constraints**, many projects devolve, with the top goal becoming "to simply work",  and being completed as soon as humanly possible.

But, this mindset can lead to:  
- **Missing edge cases** for features 
- **Poorly organized codebases** that are difficult to maintain

## 📖 **A Story Behind this Question**

Regarding the question of "Is writing bad code immoral?", I heard a great story from one of my *Computer Science professors* at Texas Tech, Dr. Michael Gelfond.  
This is where I got the idea to write this post.  

### **The Story**:
A few decades ago, Dr. Gelfond was working as a programmer for a software organization when he ran into a **nasty code bug**.  
It took him **several days** to figure out that the previous developer had built a **poorly constructed function**, causing the module he was working on to break.  

After telling us this story, Dr. Gelfond posed the question again:  
**“Is writing bad code immoral?”**  
Most of the class answered **no**.  
Then, he asked:

> **"If we murder someone a few days before they were going to die, is that immoral?"**

The answer was unanimous: **yes**.

He finished his lecture by saying:  
> **“Well, wasn’t it immoral that the last developer’s code stole two days away from my life?”**

## 💡 **My Answer: Absolutely Yes!**

That story has stuck with me for years.  
Now, my answer to the question **“Is writing bad code immoral?”** is a **resounding yes**!  

As developers, we should take **pride** in the work we produce. Not just for our **clients’** or **employers’ interests**, but simply because our goal should be to be **true craftsmen** in everything we do.  

**Coding is the closest thing we have to magic** in this world, and I feel **honored** to be able to work with it on a daily basis, along with teaching others how to do the same.  

With that in mind, it should motivate us to have a clearly defined goal of being **excellent** at our craft.

## ⚾ **Joe DiMaggio’s Wisdom for Developers**

One of my all-time favorite baseball players, **Joe DiMaggio**, said:  
> *“There is always some kid who may be seeing me for the first time. I owe him my best.”*

I try to apply this in all of the code projects I do.  
It’s easy to fall into **lazy habits**, but I remind myself that **someone might be looking** at this project for the first time, and it could be the **first impression** they have about me as a developer.  

If I take shortcuts—even if the application works—it could reflect **badly on my work**.

## 🔄 **Mistakes Are Part of Growth**

This doesn’t mean that you can’t make **mistakes**. Quite the opposite, actually!  
I’m constantly striving to become a **better developer**. This means I’m always trying to work on building **features** and **projects** that I haven’t created before.  

This naturally leads to **mistakes** during the learning process.  

However, there is a **clear distinction** between:
- 💡💡💡 Mistakes made while trying to build an **ambitious feature** 
-  ❌ ❌ ❌ **Project bugs** due to laziness and poorly written code.

# 🛠️ **How to Write Better Code**

So, if writing bad code is immoral, what can we do to combat it?  
Thankfully, we have a nice set of tools and workflows to help. Here are a few of the ones that I’ve found to be the most effective:

---

### 1. **TDD/BDD** *(Test Driven Development / Behavior Driven Development)*  

Regardless of your thoughts on TDD/BDD, there’s no denying that when implemented properly, it leads to a **well-constructed codebase**.  

- TDD encourages **low coupling** and **small methods**.
- The **refactoring** step ensures that an application is built the **right way**.  

I’m a huge fan of TDD to help with building quality code.

---

### 2. **Continuous Integration**

With a **comprehensive automated test suite**, continuous integration tools such as **CodeShip** or **Travis** ensure that code won’t be pushed to production until it’s passed the full test suite. 🛡️

I’ve had several occasions where **CodeShip blocked a bad deploy** that would’ve taken down a site.  
Additionally, it provides a **report** to the development team on what needs fixing.

---

### 3. **Pair Programming**

This is one of the most powerful tools you can use as a developer.  
**Pair programming** is when you and another developer take turns working on the same project at the same time—preferably in the same room and on the same computer.  

Whenever I’m building a **complex feature**, I always use **pair programming** since it’s like having **two brains** tackling the same problem. 🧠🧠

---

### 4. **Continuing Education**

No matter how long you’ve been a developer, **learning never stops**.  
Each day I try to learn something new—whether it’s from **tutorials**, **books**, or **blogs**.  

The key is to keep **growing** and always stay curious. 📚

I hope this post has been **thought-provoking** and will help you on your journey toward becoming a **code craftsman**.

# How to Write Better Code

If you’re not familiar with it, Pair Programming is the process where you and another developer both take turns working on a project at the same time, preferably in the same room and on the same computer. When one of you is coding, the other developer is watching and giving advice or warnings. Whenever I’m building a complex feature I will always use pair programming since it’s akin to working with two brains on the same feature.  
    Continuing Education  
    No matter how long you’ve been a developer, you’ll never reach a stage where the learning ends. Each day I try to learn something new, whether it’s from tutorials, books, or blog posts from other programmers.
