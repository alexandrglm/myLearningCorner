- A good UX design speeds up application development.

### 2. Role of the Creative Director in Application Development

- Translating the client’s vision into a functional design.

- Identifying needs and processes within the application.

- Understanding user interactions and data flow.

- Creating a multi-dimensional view of the application to foresee potential issues.

#### What is the difference between UI and UX?

In digital design, user interface (UI) refers to the interactivity,   
look, and feel of a product screen or web page, while user experience   
(UX) covers a user’s overall experience with the product or website.   


### Defining UI vs UX design

To create engaging UI, designers consider these four key elements:  

1. **Page layout**.  
   Ideally, the organization of a web page or mobile app screen should   
   seem intuitive to users. But to organize it that way, UI designers have   
   to make dozens of well-considered decisions—from the header position to   
   the amount of white space.    
   
     
2. **Color scheme and font selection**.  
   UI designers carefully choose the colors and fonts on a digital product  
   interface for consistency, accessibility, and brand alignment.  
   
     
3. **Interactive elements.** From [button design](https://www.figma.com/community/file/769870685529936013/Button-UI-%2F-Design-System) to drop-down menus, UI designers   style digital product screens to make user flows intuitive.  
   
     
4. **Wireframe and prototype fidelity.** UX designers often put together basic   wireframes and prototypes. UI designers can help transform them into high-fidelity, functional, interactive product mockups .

### ### Do you really need a UI designer to create UI?

Startups sometimes build a minimum viable product without a dedicated UI
 designer—but there are drawbacks.   

*"Graphic designers often own responsibilities for brand alignment, and will help provide some brand guidelines to build UI,"* * Hugo says.   

*"But graphic designers traditionally  focus on static printed design, so they may need to get up to speed on accessibility and responsive design—key skills UI designers bring 
to the table."*



### ## 5 steps to UX design

There's more to UX design than meets the eye on a 
user interface. The UX design process involves market research, 
wireframe development, prototype testing, and cross-functional 
collaboration.

There are five essential steps to successful UX design:

**1. Consumer and competitor research**

To deliver a positive user experience, UX designers need to understand 
their target audience.    

 Through UX research, they discover what their users like, what problems and pain points they’re facing, and how they behave online or while using an app or software.   

UX designers may also  perform competitor analysis using a  SWOT process to define their product niche.  



**2. Information architecture**

Once  UX designers understand users’ needs and behaviors, they can create 
information architecture (IA) for their product or site.   

Designers use IA as a visual blueprint, outlining essential navigation, content 
hierarchy, features, and interactions.

One key IA tool is a FLOWCHART map,  which designers use to map out key user flows and decision points.   

IA flowcharts help teams understand at a glance how the product is intended
 to work—and where there's a gap that may require additional features 
or updates.   



**3. Wireframes and prototypes**

With IA sketched out, UX designers can start turning ideas into tangible 
models, such as wireframes and prototypes.  

 Teams use these proofs of concept to test ideas, define requirements, and set feature priorities.   



**4. Testing and troubleshooting**

A mockup, a proof of concept, helps UX designers, developers, and product owners see how features will work in practice.   

If testing reveals issues like confusing navigation, menus, or  forms, the team can adjust them before launch.  



**5. Ongoing updates**

Even  after a digital product has entered the market, a UX designer’s job is 
never truly done.   

With new user feedback and back-end analytics, they can design updates and improvements.  

For example, analytics may reveal that an e-commerce checkout process is too long, leading to a high cart abandonment rate. To address this issue, UX designers may streamline some checkout steps.   







### ### How to recognize successful UX design

What does UX success look like? According to Peter Morville, author of *Information Architecture for the World Wide Web*, successful UX answers yes to these [seven user experience questions](https://semanticstudios.com/user_experience_design/):Is the site or product useful?



![IMG](https://semanticstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2004/06/honeycomb.jpg)

- Is it usable?
- Is it desirable?
- Have you made it findable—that is, will a user know where to find what they're looking for?
- Is it accessible?
- Is it credible?
- Is it valuable?






### ## Where do UX and UI overlap?

Scan  online job listings, and you'll notice employers seeking UX/UI 
designers— digital designers who can fulfill both roles.  

This may be a stretch, but it's possible,.

"You can  work in a team where you have UI designers and UX designers as separate
 disciplines, But a product designer or UX designer might take on UI responsibilities, working alongside someone like a business analyst to understand all of the scenarios that need to be covered."  

While UI is generally understood as a specialized subset of UX work, there are three key areas of overlap:

1. **User-centered design expertise.** Both disciplines require designers to develop empathy for the end user and consider how users want to use a product or site.
2. **Cross-functional teams.** Designers
   working on UI and UX must collaborate closely with graphic designers 
   and developers to make products and sites appealing, accessible, 
   and usable.
3. **Design tools.** UX and UI designers use many of the same kind of tools.

# Video Lesson Speech

[ENG]  





**Jordan Hudgens:** Standing right next to me is Jesse Cook. Jesse is the CEO and the   Creative Director for the Slate dev shop in Lehi, Utah. I've had the privilege of  
 working with Jesse for over a year now and I've absolutely loved the   
experience.    

He has been able to completely upgrade the way that devCamp   
looks, so if you've noticed a difference, then you have Jesse to thank   
for that. He is very good at what he does.  

For this course, I wanted to bring someone in who is truly a   
specialist. I decide not to teach the user experience course on my own   
because it's not my specialty. I've only received very light and   
informal training in UX and UI, which I think is the case for many   
developers.  

That's the purpose behind this course. We want to teach you what    
happens and what's needed in order to properly design an application.  

Now, I think one of the biggest problems with the perception of   
design in the development world is that people may think designers are   
just the people who pick out what colors and fonts go on the screen, but  
 there is **so** much more to it than that. There is an entire science behind how user   experience is built.  

I want to introduce Jesse for that side of the process, and in this   
guide, we're going to take a high-level look at what "creative   
direction" is. Jesse, talk a little bit about some of the things, from a  
 creative direction perspective, that you do when you're working with   
clients or when you're working on an application.  

**Jesse Cook:** *We specifically work a lot with   
clients, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you're always going to   
be in that position. You might be working for some tech company that has  
 one app and you have a manager that you're reporting to, but they are   
very similar scenarios.*  

*The idea is that the creative director is approached because 
something needs to be built or changed. What they do is take the vision 
of whoever's approached them, and get that vision on paper. It seems a 
lot more straightforward than it usually ends up being.*  

*The analogy that I always give my clients is to draw a bicycle.   
The idea is that everyone knows what a bicycle looks like; they know   
what an app looks like in their mind. But when you actually sit people   
down, statistically, 75 percent of people will draw a bicycle   
incorrectly, even though we all know what it looks like.*  

*That's what I tell my clients. They know what it looks like but   
they don't necessarily know how the data is going around. They might not  
 even know all the users that need to exist to create that data. They   
think, "Oh! Then this needs to be approved!" Well, who's approving that   
procedure? Who is interacting with this data? They need to be able to   
see the multi-dimensional structure that these apps create. And* that's *what  
 the creative director does. They help bring this idea to a point where   
you can really follow the entire objective all the way through to all   
the different users.*  

**JH:** That's awesome, and it's something that I've   
found so critical through the years because the user experience is not   
my specialty. When I'm on a project by myself, or I'm the person in   
charge of the UX, it doesn't look as good as when I'm able to go and   
implement *your* designs. It slows down my progress because I'm   
spending so much time simply figuring out where all the components on   
the page need to be, and who's allowed to interact with them, and what   
happens if they click on this button versus this other one. Whereas, my   
development time speeds up astronomically when Jesse sends me a set of   
screens and a full set of wireframes on what I need to go build.  

That is a huge part of why we wanted to build this course, because if  
 you can learn how to develop your own UI and UX -- have you heard of   
the "Unicorn" term?  

**JC:** *Yeah, yeah.*  

**JH:** If you've never heard of it, there is a term for  
 if you are very good at design and also very good at development. The   
reason is that such a person is about as rare as a unicorn. We want to   
turn everyone who goes through this course into a unicorn.  

We have a number of great modules throughout this system and we also   
took a little bit of a different approach, here. I have seen a number of  
 other courses that combined both UI and UX into the same course. I   
purposefully wanted to create one UX course and one UI course because   
they're completely different disciplines. It's usually the same person   
who's asked you to do them, just like you, Jesse.  

**JC:** *Haha!  *

**JH:** But if you start to think, "Oh, if I'm doing   
UI/UX, that means that I'm just working a lot in Photoshop and making   
things look pretty," I think that completely devalues the entire UX   
portion.  

**JC:** *Right.  *

**JH:** While we were going through the outline for this  
 course, we started to realize how much time was spent in building out   
the right user experience, as opposed to just making things look pretty.  
 I wanted to make sure that we really focused on that so that you would   
value it as much as it really deserves. I can promise that when you   
actually get out and start building real-world applications, having this  
 skill set can set you apart from all the other developers that are out   
there.  

**JC:** *Oh, absolutely! My developers are incredibly  
 valuable because, occasionally, I get some things wrong, and sometimes   
it will get to the point where I'm explaining something to either the   
CTO, or the CTO is explaining it to the developers, and, if they've   
really developed that critical thinking, they might say "Where is this   
coming from? Where am I supposed to pull this data from?" And maybe the   
application needs a higher level admin or a different user, or maybe it   
needs to happen on a different page. It's* ***so*** *helpful  
 for those things to be found sooner, and not after two weeks of   
development. At that point, they may realize they have to go back and   
refactor a bunch of stuff.*  

*I love it when my developers can, right off the bat, identify   
something that I've missed. It's definitely a unicorn moment. A lot of   
times, something just falls through the cracks. And then eventually it's  
 like - oh my gosh - how did I miss that? It's definitely something    
where, if you can really hone those skills to be able to see the   
multi-dimensional aspect of these applications really quickly and bounce  
 back and forth between the granular and the big picture--You want to be  
 able to zoom in and see that, but you don't want to be so close to it   
that you can't see and understand the bigger picture.*  

**JH:** Absolutely. That's a great introduction to   
everything that we're going to be going through in this course. We're   
going to be talking about the different concepts you'll need to learn in  
 order to build a solid user experience, and we're going to be using a   
number of case studies that we have worked on so that we can tell you   
some of the things we did that were good and also a few the things we   
might have done differently.
