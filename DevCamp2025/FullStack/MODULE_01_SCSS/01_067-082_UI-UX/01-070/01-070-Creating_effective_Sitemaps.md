# MODULE 01 - 070: Creating effective Sitemaps

# Video Lesson Speech

[ENG]  

**Jordan Hudgens:** In this guide we're going to learn 
what a sitemap is and how to construct one. We'll talk about some of the
 goals you should have when you're building one and how you can 
translate those into building the user experience. We'll also discuss 
providing the sitemap to your developers so that they know what screens 
to build.

**Jesse Cook:** *The frame of mind that you should be
 in when you approach a sitemap is that it should answer all of the user
 stories. We've created all these user stories, so I'm going to create a
 separate sitemap for each user. Whatever those user stories are, I 
start going through them. Jim needs to be able to message, so I need to 
make sure that there is a messaging page. Once I create that page in the
 sitemap, I indicate the main unique actions that happen on that page.*

*There's a lot of "dealer's choice" here. Most people are going to
 build their sitemaps a little bit differently. They're going to use 
different programs. I really like Lucidchart because of its team aspect 
and that you can have multiple people participate on it. Then it becomes
 about how you indicate what a page is, and what actions are.*

*Another thing is: how granular do you get? You might think, "OK, I
 have all these pages, and I can click 15 things on each one of these 
pages." Well, sure, but you don't have to indicate that on every single 
page. That's a little too granular. In my opinion, it's not very 
productive, because you could click the logo on every single page and 
it'll take you to the home page. But I don't need to indicate that on 
every single page of my sitemap.*

*Here, you can see that there are two main shapes: rectangles and 
diamonds. This is my own personal thing. You may be working inside of a 
company that already has these conventions established, or you'll be 
coming up with them yourself, but I like using rectangles for pages and 
diamonds for indicating user actions that solve user stories.*

*You can see that these actions either take you to other actions 
or to another page. When you map it all out, you should be left with a 
picture of all the pages that need to exist and the key actions that can
 be taken from each of them. This will really give you a clear idea of 
how you're going to solve all of the user stories you've already 
created.*

**JH:** That's awesome. It's a great example of how 
you've translated user stories directly into something functional that 
you can use.

Now, Jesse, after you've built the sitemap, which stakeholders do you
 meet with and get feedback from? Obviously, I'm assuming the client, 
but do you also take this to the developers? Who else are you connecting
 with?

**JC:** *It'll hit the developers* after *it's
 been approved by the client (or the product owner or whoever is running
 that). You'll work through the sitemap with them, with the user stories
 right alongside it. A lot of times, clients will get kind of glossy 
when they see this. It's not the sexy thing that they see in their mind.
 But the main thing is that you're saying: here's our list of user 
stories for Jim. Jim wants to be able to message. Bam, this is where he 
goes to message. What else can he do? He can send a message, he can 
receive a message, and he can flag a message, so let's indicate those. 
What happens after the flags a message? Does he go to another screen? 
Does he go to an approval screen, or something else? We can indicate 
that. We have our messages screen represented in our sitemap, and we 
have an action under it: "flag message." Then we can have an arrow that 
takes us to review flagged content, and I can represent that.*

*When I get into later phases of the development I'll have a very 
clear idea. It's so much better than just taking notes, or even skipping
 past it. You might be inclined to say "I've got my user stories, let's 
get this done," but this is helping you fill in the gaps so that you 
don't have to rework your designs. You don't end up saying, "Oh dang it!
 I totally forgot about this entire thing. I've got to go back through 
all my designs," because design is a lot harder to manipulate than just 
going in and adding rectangles and diamonds.*

**JH:** That brings up a great point. We talk about 
stakeholders and how important it is to have this kind of foundation to 
look back at. I remember, for one pretty large-scale application, I had a
 client who was not technical whatsoever. I had already built close to 
half of the application, and, while ***I*** thought 
it was going well, this client had nothing to look at that he could 
understand. He couldn't go look at my code, the application wasn't ready
 to prototype, and because of that he kept asking for what was 
essentially a sitemap. He wanted to see lines going to boxes to see what
 one user could do and what another couldn't. I ended up having to build
 something like this halfway through the project. If I would've done it 
at the beginning, it would have helped me in my development, but even 
more important is that it would have helped the client understand all 
the processes that were taking place.

**JC:** *Right, right. And obviously, after this has 
been approved by the client, you're taking this to team leads, and the 
team leads are taking it to the developers. So, regardless of how 
interested you are in sitemaps, as a developer you will need to know how
 to understand them. And they're not terribly complicated. Of course, 
that may also depend on who's creating the sitemap for you, but I don't 
like making mine terribly complicated because that's just miserable.*

**JH:** Right.

**JC:** *It's important to be able to understand this
 because, the better the communication bridge between creative and 
development, the smoother every project is going to go. The better you 
can understand the sitemaps that are being created, the more valuable 
you are as a developer because you won't have to walk through it over 
and over and over again. You're going to see holes and all the things we
 talked about before, and you'll be able to get a quick picture of the 
project and know what's being communicated.*

**JH:** Absolutely. I love the tools we have now that we
 didn't have a few years ago. You could see in the example sitemap that 
there are spots for comments. When I was working with the design team on
 this specific diagram they would ask me questions like, "What type of 
functionality are you looking for right here?" when they didn't have all
 the clarification they needed. And that's a great thing, because, not 
only are these tools good for building the sitemap initially, but 
they're also good for collaboration *while* it's being built. You
 can clear up a lot of mistakes in the very beginning by being able to 
communicate properly with all the stakeholders.

**JC:** *Right! I definitely get pinged every once in
 awhile by developers asking, "What is going on here? What is this page?
 Where did this come from?" It's really nice when you don't have to cut 
through anything, you can just go right to the question and you're all 
on the same page really quickly.*
