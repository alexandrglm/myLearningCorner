# Video Lesson Speech

Now that you have some of the fundamental knowledge down on building a 
user experience, you're going to get your own hands dirty in building 
your own and you're going to be building your own portfolio application.  

**Jordan Hudgens:** This is a 
user experience project. In the User Interface course, we'll get into 
making it actually look good, but in this project, we're simply going to
 focus on the user experience. What we want you to do is go through.

Start with step one, which is the prime objective. Define what the 
prime objective of this system is. It needs to be a little bit more 
specific than "this is a portfolio application." It comes down to what 
you want people to really see and the type of experience you want them 
to have.

**Jesse Cook:** *Whenever doing a marketing 
website--and where you're marketing yourself--you'll ask, "What am I 
trying to accomplish? Am I selling a product?" Yes. You're selling 
yourself. You're the product, so after identifying what the prime 
objective is, all your content should be trying to achieve that 
objective. With any marketing site, whether it's a purchase, subscribe, 
or Contact Me button, these are the things that you want your users to 
do, whether they're possible employers, partners, or customers. So, 
identify, first, what you want these people to do, and who these people 
are, and then make sure everything about this website revolves around 
that.*

**JH:** The deliverables for this project are a sitemap and a low fidelity wireframe.

The sitemap will show all the pages on your portfolio application, and how users can navigate from one to the other.

With the low fidelity wireframe, it is not going to look the way that
 your final website is actually going to look. Instead, this is going to
 be a high level and focus on navigability and what components will be 
on each page.

**JC:** *The site map should be pretty easy because 
you don't have a whole lot of actions, or a lot of pages. As far as 
tools, for the sitemap I use Lucidchart. That's really good for teams 
but also they have a free trial. Like I said, it's dealer's choice as 
far as diagramming conventions.*

*For the wireframe tools, I personally use Adobe XD. That's kind 
of an expensive program, so a free alternative is InVision, which has 
some pretty good features.*

**JH:** You can use either a paid application or, if 
you're just starting to get into this, then a free tool like InVision is
 perfectly fine.

If you end up focusing your development career in the UI/UX world 
then you'll most likely be using some of the more expensive and advanced
 tools. But in order to complete this project, you can use completely 
free applications or free trials of those.

**JC:** *If it's a little daunting at first, get a 
whiteboard or a piece of paper. If you just want to focus on one thing 
at a time, and you don't want to learn a new piece of software then 
whiteboard and sketchbooks are great options. I spend a lot of time on 
the whiteboard because I might want to quickly sketch out three 
different options. You don't have to necessarily dive right into the 
deep end. If you're feeling a little bit hesitant or apprehensive then, 
absolutely, feel free to try it out.*

**JH:** And my best advice for going through this 
project successfully is really to follow the pattern that Jesse's 
outlined. Notice how it started with the most generic, high-level 
concepts such as the overall goal of the system. Then, with each step 
down the creative process, things got more and more detailed. Don't try 
to jump in and build your wireframes right when this video's done. 
Follow the process. Having a good portfolio application is important, 
but the much more important thing is actually learning these skills and 
this workflow so that later on these things become second nature.

**JC:** *When going through this process, identify 
the difference between user interface and user experience. For this 
part, when you're focusing on user experience, think about the content 
that you're going to be putting in there. This is when you're actually 
thinking through storytelling. With a marketing site, you're trying to 
tell a good story. You're trying to identify what propositions you want 
to talk about, and in what order. Think about when you want to slip in 
those calls to action. It might change a little when you start putting 
it into the design, but during the wireframing, you should be thinking 
about the content.*

*If there's one piece of advice I can give you it's to keep the 
content as small as possible. Have your headlines very direct, be very 
precise, and then any supporting smaller text that's underneath it keep 
as minimal as possible. You want to communicate in as few words as 
possible, especially with an employer. You don't want to waste their 
time telling them what your favorite fruit snack was when you were 10.*

**JH:** Now, depending on your experience level, you may
 not have knowledge of all of those different components. You may not 
know what your specialty is going to be. That is perfectly fine. I don't
 want that to stop you from going out and building this. Instead, you 
could put something like: "This is what I think my specialty is." It 
could be a full stack developer or a front end developer, but make those
 a focal point. You're not locked into that believe me. You can change 
at any time. I constantly am changing my own portfolio applications

Right now this is all about developing the right system because it's 
one thing to hear it from us. It's a completely different thing when you
 actually get into the weeds and start building out these types of 
sitemaps and wireframes. You're going to find there are some nuances 
that you really can only learn when you're doing it yourself.

Good luck with the project, and we'll see you on the next course!
