# MODULE 1 - 004 SaSS vs SCSS
So far we have been through a full overview of SCSS, walked through the preprocessors step so you can see what code was written and then we looked at how it got translated into something the browser could understand.  
***
There is something that might be a little bit confusing whether it's in some type of coding interview situation, or just in general as reading documentation.  
There are actually **two different types of SASS syntax**:
- **SASS**
- In which SASS was evolved: **SCSS**

Technically, both of those are called SASS which makes for some kind of confusing component when you're first starting to learn it.  
Here we are going to talk about the differences there are between the two and what we are going to be using for the course.  

1. **SASS was the original version**.
   - ‚ùå It does not look anything like CSS. ‚úÖ It cares about things such as indentation.
   - ü´µ When using SASS all of your code has to be segmented.
   - ü´µ It has to have the right number of spaces right in front of each set of style definitions.
   - ‚ùå It doesn't have {curly braces}
   - ‚úÖ It has plus‚ûï signs and equalüü∞signs all over the place.
   - If you've ever worked with *Hammill* or *Slim*, you may notice it looks very similar to that type of setup.

What you will see more often is SCSS and that's what we're going to be using in this entire course.  

## Reasons to choose SCSS in production
There are many reasons why SCSS is used so widely:
1. üìà **Lower Learning-curve** :
   * It looks exactly like CSS.
   * It uses almost the same syntax. This makes it much more familiar.
2. ‚ôæÔ∏è **Backward Compatibility**:
   * If you want to write just pure CSS code an SCSS file will still process it where the original version of SASS would actually throw an error.

I wanted to go over these differences due to the fact that during your research you are going to run into both syntax.  
Without this brief overview, it may seem very confusing.

Differences Between Sass and Scss
So far we have been through a full overview of SCSS, walked through the preprocessors step so you can see what code was written and then we looked at how it got translated into something the browser could understand.

There is something that might be a little bit confusing whether it's in some type of coding interview situation or just in general as reading documentation. There are actually two different types of SASS syntax. There is SASS and then there is SCSS. Now technically both of those are called SASS which makes for some kind of confusing component when you're first starting to learn it. Here we are going to talk about the differences there are between the two and what we are going to be using for the course.

SASS was the original version. It does not look anything like CSS and it cares about things such as indentation.

What you will see more often is SCSS and that's what we're going to be using in this entire course. There are many reasons why SCSS is used so widely. One is that it looks exactly like CSS. Also, it uses curly braces and semicolons to end each style definition. This makes it much more familiar and the learning curve is also much lower. Also if you want to write just pure CSS code an SCSS file will still process it where the original version of SASS would actually throw an error.

Diferencias entre Sass y Scss

Hasta ahora hemos explorado a fondo SCSS, hemos visto c√≥mo funciona el proceso de precompilaci√≥n y c√≥mo se traduce el c√≥digo en algo que el navegador pueda entender.

Sin embargo, puede haber cierta confusi√≥n, especialmente en entrevistas t√©cnicas o al leer documentaci√≥n, ya que existen dos sintaxis de Sass: Sass y Scss. Aunque ambas se conocen como Sass, esto puede generar cierta confusi√≥n al principio. A continuaci√≥n, explicaremos las diferencias entre ambas y por qu√© usaremos Scss en este curso.

Sass fue la versi√≥n original. Su sintaxis es muy diferente a la de CSS y se basa en la indentaci√≥n. Todo el c√≥digo debe estar correctamente indentado y segmentado. No utiliza llaves ni punto y coma, sino signos de suma e igual. Si has trabajado con Haml o Slim, te resultar√° familiar esta sintaxis.

Scss, por otro lado, es la sintaxis m√°s com√∫n y la que utilizaremos en este curso. Su principal ventaja es que su sintaxis es muy similar a la de CSS, utilizando llaves y punto y coma para delimitar bloques y propiedades. Esto facilita mucho el aprendizaje y la transici√≥n desde CSS puro. Adem√°s, los archivos Scss pueden procesar c√≥digo CSS sin problemas, a diferencia de Sass.

¬øPor qu√© usar Scss?

    Sintaxis familiar: Se parece mucho a CSS, lo que reduce la curva de aprendizaje.
    Flexibilidad: Permite escribir c√≥digo CSS puro dentro de archivos Scss.
    Ampliamente utilizado: Es la sintaxis m√°s popular y soportada por la mayor√≠a de las herramientas y frameworks.

En resumen, aunque Sass y Scss son parte de la misma familia, sus sintaxis son bastante diferentes. Scss, al ser m√°s similar a CSS y m√°s flexible, es la opci√≥n preferida para la mayor√≠a de los desarrolladores.

¬øPor qu√© es importante conocer esta diferencia?

Es fundamental entender las diferencias entre Sass y Scss para poder elegir la herramienta adecuada para cada proyecto y para evitar confusiones al leer documentaci√≥n o c√≥digo de otros desarrolladores.

En este curso, nos centraremos en Scss debido a su popularidad y facilidad de uso.

Espero que esta explicaci√≥n te haya aclarado las diferencias entre Sass y Scss. ¬°Continuemos explorando el mundo de SCSS!
