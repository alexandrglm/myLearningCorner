## Welcome to Algorithms

This is an **online course** developed by **Bob Sedgewick** and **Kevin Wayne** at Princeton University. We'll begin with an overview of **why you might want to study algorithms** and discuss the **resources necessary** for this course.

---

## What is This Course?

This is an **intermediate-level survey course** on algorithms with emphasis on **programming and problem-solving** in real-world application contexts.

### Core Focus: Two Fundamental Concepts

**Algorithms**: **Methods for solving problems**. Step-by-step procedures enabling computational solutions.

**Data structures**: **Methods to store information**. Organisational approaches managing data associated with problems. Algorithms and data structures **go hand in hand**—data structures store information; algorithms process it.

---

## Course Topics: Parts I & II

### Part I: Fundamentals

**Data types**: Stacks, queues, bags, priority queues—**basic data structures** fundamental to all methods we'll consider.

**Sorting**: Classic algorithms putting things in order—**quicksort, mergesort, heapsort, radix sorts**.

**Searching**: Classic methods for data retrieval—**binary search trees, red-black binary search trees, hash tables**.

### Part II: Advanced Algorithms

**Graph algorithms**: **Classic graph searching algorithms** (BFS, DFS), **minimum spanning tree algorithms**, **shortest path algorithms** (Dijkstra, Prim, Kruskal).

**String processing**: **Regular expressions, data compression, string algorithms**.

**Advanced algorithms**: Sophisticated algorithms leveraging fundamentals developed earlier in the course.

## Why Study Algorithms?

### 1. Broad and Far-Reaching Impact

Algorithms are **pervasive across all domains**:

- **Internet**: Web search, packet routing, distributed systems
- **Biology**: Genome sequencing, protein folding
- **Commercial computing**: Business systems, data processing
- **Computer graphics**: Movies, video games, virtual reality
- **Security**: Cryptography, secure communications
- **Multimedia**: MP3, JPG, DivX, HDTV, face recognition
- **Social networks**: Recommendations, news feeds, social analysis
- **Scientific applications**: Particle collision simulation, genome studies

Algorithms power **virtually every technological advancement** we encounter.

### 2. Ancient Roots, Modern Opportunities

**Historical significance**:
- **300 BCE**: Algorithm study traces to **Euclid** (ancient mathematics)
- **1930s**: The concept formalised here at **Princeton** by **Church and Turing**
- **Recent decades**: Most algorithms we study were **discovered recently**
- **Contemporary discovery**: Some groundbreaking algorithms have been discovered by **undergraduate students** in courses like this

**Opportunity**: **Plenty of algorithms remain undiscovered**—waiting for students like you.

### 3. Solve Problems Otherwise Unaddressable

Some computational problems are **impossible to solve without appropriate algorithms**.

**Example: Network connectivity problem**

*Problem statement*: Given a large set of items connected pairwise, determine whether a path exists between specific items through the connections.

**Visual challenge**: Visual inspection cannot reliably determine connectivity in large networks. We need a **computer programme**. More importantly, we need an **efficient algorithm** to solve it in reasonable time.

**Result**: The algorithm determines connectivity accurately and efficiently.

### 4. Intellectual Stimulation

Algorithms are **intrinsically interesting objects** worthy of study.

> "An algorithm must be seen to be believed." — Donald Knuth (pioneer in algorithmic studies)

You cannot merely think about algorithms; you must **work with them directly**.

> "Great algorithms are the poetry of computation. Just like verse, they can be terse, elusive, dense, and even mysterious. But once unlocked, they cast a brilliant new light on some aspect of computing." — Francis Sullivan

Algorithms offer **intellectual challenges** similar to solving puzzles or appreciating art.

### 5. Become a Proficient Programmer

**Algorithm and data structure knowledge is essential** for professional programming competence.

> "The difference between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he considers his code or his data structures more important. Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships." — Linus Torvalds (creator of Linux)

> "Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs" — Niklaus Wirth (computer science pioneer)

**Professional reality**: Efficient algorithms and appropriate data structures distinguish excellent programmes from mediocre ones.

### 6. Unlock Secrets of Life and the Universe

Algorithms have become a **common language for understanding nature**.

**Paradigm shift in science**:

**20th Century approach**: Scientists developed **mathematical models** to understand natural phenomena. However, these models proved **difficult to solve** and challenging to **test against observations**.

**21st Century approach**: Scientists now develop **computational models** simulating natural processes to better understand them. **Algorithms play an extremely important role** in this computational approach.

**Impact**: Algorithmic models are **replacing mathematical models** in scientific inquiry across disciplines.

### 7. Career Advancement

Knowledge of **effective algorithms and data structures significantly improves your chances** of **succeeding in technology industry job interviews**.

This practical advantage complements intellectual benefits.

3. **Solve previously unaddressable problems**
4. **Intellectual stimulation** rivalling mathematics and arts
5. **Become a proficient programmer** indispensable to quality software
6. **Unlock fundamental scientific understanding** of nature
7. **Fun and profit**—career and professional advancement

> **Why study anything else?**

Whilst many subjects deserve study, there is **no good reason not to study algorithms**.
