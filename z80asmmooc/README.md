### Reasons
As long as nowadays compiling on Z80 might be seen as oudated (even the Z80 is still being used with the Z180 revision), newer architectures uses the same principles whose few differences are a higher complexity, that's the revealing the relevance of adquiring these knowledge:

* Just for fun.
* It's just learning!
  - System architectures.
  - Assembly - Machine code.
  - De-oxidating the brain by working with base numbers' conversions (Base10 to Base16, Base16 to Base2, ...)
 

### What can I expect for?

* Learning, mastering, the Z80 processor, getting solid basis and the deepest.  
* Platform: AMSTRAD CPC. (Hey, SEGA lovers, you are invited too). 
* Using low programming languages (at a harware layer) as :  
  * Machine code: The code machines understand.  
  * Assembler: next to machine code, but more affordable when creating, editing, ....  
* Creating some apps.  
* Adquring the kind of knowledge which is only understood for the real Z80/ASSEMBLER lovers.ðŸ¤ª
