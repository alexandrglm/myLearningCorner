### Objectives:
As long as nowadays assembling on Z80 might be seen as oudated, newer architectures are still using the same principles instead (which a few differences as a more complexity) so, this reveals the relevance of adquiring these knowledge.

* Learning, mastering, the Z80 processor, getting solid basis and the deepest.
* 8BIT Board used: AMSTRAD CPC / SEGA Z80 programs may be ported to this course.
* Using low programming languages (at a harware layer) as :
  * Machine code: The code machines understand.
  * Assembler: next to machine code, but more affordable when creating, editing, ....
* Creating some apps.

***
# DEZ80 0.2: Course structure
* Method used: Learning-by doing. Practicing-by-doing.
* 4 MODULES, each with exercises and a final capstone.
***
# DEZ80 0.3: Video learning ways:
The course is structured by using videos in a three different perspectives:
**A. Practice**  
B. Theory   
C. Learnings

#### A. PRACTICE  
The mandatory way to be follow, in which every knowledge is adquired by coding, testing, practicing.

#### B. THEORY  +  C. LEARNINGS
B and C are not esential but, both, allows to get a deeper knowledge about the Module is being learning.
***
# DEZ80 0.4: Exercises, capstone, evaluations.
- Self-evaluated exercises.
- Non-unique solution learning. 
- Self-giving solutions, which allows to perform a better solutions based on the originals.
- A non-certificating course, but completing a Portfolio. The kind of knowledge which is adquired only for the real Z80/ASSEMBLER lovers.
