#### Content:  
- A guide explaining about Z80 instructions.
- Deeper explanation about machine-code instructions used on course's Module 1.
- Executing & debugging examples using WinAPE.

Every instruction allowed to be executed by the CPU is documented, like in this table example given from [this site](https://clrhome.org/table/) :
![IMG_Z80_Opcodes](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1dcedf84-e6f6-4f69-a924-77d65030a58b)  

Every Opcode is ordered by its machine code.

There's no limit of use for any of these more than the own each opcodes' limit which is documented.

## Opcodes used in this Module

### `3E - 00` - `ld a, xx`
Copies 

### `32 - 00 FF` - `ld (FF00), a`
Copies what's inside in `a` Accumulator register onto the given 16-bit memory address.  

### `21 - 00 FF` - `ld hl, FF00`  
Copies the given 16 bit value (‚ö†Ô∏è FF00, in this case, **is not a memory address, but a 16 bit number** that needs to be adressed to both 8bit registers) onto `h` and `l`.  

### `22 - 00 FF` - `ld (FF00), hl`  
Copies what's inside `h` and `l` registers onto the given memory address (This case, this Opcode is refering a 16 bit memory address). 
üí° This is the main method to store 16 bit data value into a specific memory address.

### `18 - 00` - `jr 00`
Perform a relative jump (`JR`) by adding the given value to `PC` register. Then, the programm counter will follow the execution from that "added" point.
