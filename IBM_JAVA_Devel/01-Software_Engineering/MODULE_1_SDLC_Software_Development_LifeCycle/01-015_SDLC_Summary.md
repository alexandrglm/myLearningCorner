# 01-015: SDLC - Summary

### Software Engineering Fundamentals

**Software engineering** is the **application of scientific principles** to the design and creation of software.

**Responsibilities of a software engineer** include **designing, building, and maintaining software systems**.

### SDLC Benefits

Using the **SDLC** improves efficiency and reduces risks by:

- **Letting team members know** what they should be working on and when
- **Facilitating communication** between the customer, other stakeholders, and the development team
- **Letting stakeholders know** where they fit into that process
- **Letting cross-domain teams know** when they have completed their tasks so development can move to the next phase

### Common Software Engineering Processes

**Common software engineering processes** are requirements gathering, design, coding, testing, releasing, and documenting.

### Requirements Gathering Process

The **requirement gathering process** entails:

- **Identifying stakeholders**
- **Establishing goals and objectives**
- **Eliciting requirements** from the stakeholders
- **Documenting the requirements**
- **Analysing, prioritising, and confirming** the requirements

### Documentation Specifications

#### **SRS** (Software Requirements Specification)
A document that **captures the functionalities** that the software should perform and **establishes benchmarks or service levels** for its performance.

#### **URS** (User Requirements Specification)
A **subset of the SRS** that **details user specification requirements**.

#### **SysRS** (System Requirements Specification)
Contains the **same information as an SRS**, but can also additionally include **system capabilities, interfaces, and user characteristics, policy requirements, regulation requirements, personnel requirements, performance requirements, security requirements, and system acceptance criteria**.

### SDLC Methodologies

**Waterfall, V-shape model, and agile** are all **different methodologies** for implementing the software development life cycle.

---

### Testing Types

**Functional testing** is concerned with **inputs and corresponding outputs** of the system under test.

**Non-functional testing** tests for attributes such as **performance, security, scalability, and availability**.

**Regression testing** confirms that a **recent change** to the application, such as a **bug fix**, does **not adversely affect** already existing functionality.

---

### Documentation Types

**Types of documentation** include **requirements, design, technical, quality assurance, and user**.

---

### Project Roles

**There are many different roles** involved in a software engineering project. Some of them include:

- **Project manager or SCRUM master**
- **Stakeholder**
- **System or software architect**
- **UX designer**
- **Software developer**
- **Tester or QA engineer**
- **Site reliability or Ops engineer**
- **Product manager or owner**
- **Technical writer or information developer**
