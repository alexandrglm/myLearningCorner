**Software documentation** is information describing what a software product is and how to use it, comprising written, guide, or graphical assets associated with development and use.  

![](./01-012-_IMG2.png)

Essential across all SDLC phases, it targets diverse audiences: 

*   The End-Uusers
*   Software developers
*   QA engineers
*   System administrators
*   Any other involved stakeholder

### Two Main Categories

#### **Product Documentation**
Relates to product functionality, describing features and capabilities.

#### **Process Documentation**
Describes how to complete tasks, providing requirements for quality business process implementation.

### Five Types of Product Documentation

#### **Requirements Documentation**

![](./01-012-_IMG5.png)

Written during the planning phase for development teams (developers, architects, QA). Describes expected software features and functionality, including:

-   The Software Requirements Specifications (SRS)
-   System Requirement Specifications (SysRS)
-   User Acceptance Specifications



#### **Design Documentation**

Written by software architects and development teams explaining how software will be built to meet requirements.  
Comprises conceptual and technical design documents.


#### **Technical Documentation**

![](./01-012-_IMG7.png)

Includes:
*   Code comments helping developers understand code behaviour
*   Working papers explaining code functionality,
*   Documents recording engineers' ideas and thoughts during project implementation.


#### **Quality Assurance Documentation**

![](./01-012-_IMG8.png)

Encompasses testing strategy, progress, and metrics.   

Types include:
*   Test plans
*   Test data
*   Test scenarios
*   Test cases
*   Test strategies
*   **Traceability matrices** (mapping test cases to requirements)


#### **User Documentation**

Intended for end-users, explaining software operation, installation, or troubleshooting.  

May includes FAQs, installation and help guidances, videos, tutorials, and user manuals.

### Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

**SOPs** are written, step-by-step documentation explaining how to accomplish common yet complex, organisation-specific tasks.

Unlike general process documentation overviews, **SOPs provide detailed procedural guidance**. 

Formats may include:
-   Flowcharts
-   Hierarchical outlines
-   Sequential instructions.


**Example**:   
>A software engineering firm's specific steps for merging code into the main branch differ from general version control knowledge and require organisation-specific SOP documentation.

### Documentation Maintenance

Documentation must remain current throughout the SDLC.  

During the maintenance phase, updates occur when software changes (e.g., user interface modifications require corresponding online manual updates).  

Periodic reviews ensure accuracy, and organisations must allocate resources for this critical task.

## Video Lesson

Hello and welcome to **Software Documentation**. After this guide, you will be able to: **List documentation formats. Compare and contrast product documentation to process documentation. Describe the categories and types of documentation. And explain the purpose of standard operating procedures**.

**Software documentation** is **information** about the software that **describes what the product is** and **how to use it**. These can be **written, video, or graphical assets** associated with a software **product's development and use**.

**Documentation** can be in **any of these three formats**. **Documentation** is an **essential aspect** of software engineering **applicable across all the phases** of SDLC. **Software Documentation** can be **written for different types of audiences** – such as **end users, software developers, QA engineers, system administrators and other stakeholders**.

**Documentation** can be **divided into two categories, product and process**. **Product documentation** relates to the **product's functionality**, whereas **process documentation** describes **how to complete a task**. **Process documentation** should **provide the requirements** for the **quality implementation** of a **business process**.

Now, let's discuss some **specific types of product documentation**. There are **many types of documentation**, and we will discuss **five categories** including **requirements, design, technical, quality assurance, and user documentation**.

**Requirements documentation** is **written** during the **planning phase** of the SDLC and is **intended for the development team** including the **developers, architects, and QA personnel**. **Requirements documentation** describes the **expected features and functionality** of the software system. It includes the **software requirements specifications, system requirement specifications, and user acceptance specifications**.

**Design documentation** is **written by the software architects** and the **development team** to **explain how the software will be built** to **meet the requirements**. It consists of **both conceptual and technical design documents**.

**Technical documentation** includes **comments written in the code** to help **other developers read the code** to **understand its behaviour**. It also may include **working papers** that explain **how the code works** and **documents** that **record engineers' ideas and thoughts** during project implementation.

**Quality assurance documentation** includes **all documents** that pertain to a **testing team's strategy, progress, and metrics**. **Types of test documentation** include **test plans, test data, test scenarios, test cases, test strategies, and traceability matrices**. **Traceability matrices** map **test cases** to their **requirements**.

**User documentation** is **intended for end-users** and **explains how to operate the software** or **help them to install or troubleshoot** the system. **End-user documentation** includes **frequently asked questions, installation and help guides, tutorials, and user manuals**.

**Standard operating procedures**, called **SOPs**, often accompany **process documentation**. **Process documentation** provides an **overview** of a process, but **SOPs** go through **much greater detail**. The **SOP** is **written documentation** that **explains step-by-step** how to **accomplish a common, yet complex task** that is **organisation specific**. For example, **checking in code** using a code repository is **common knowledge** for a software engineer.

However, an **organisation** might have **specific steps** to follow for that **organisation** in order to **get code merged** into the **main branch**. The **SOP documentation** explains those **steps in detail**. **SOPs** can be in the form of a **flowchart, a hierarchical outline, or step-by-step instructions**.

**Documentation**, in any form, must be **kept up to date**. Take for instance **online user manuals**. If a **cloud-based application user interface changes**, then the accompanying **online documentation** must be **updated accordingly**. **Businesses** need to **ensure they allot resources** for this step.

With regards to the **software development** and the **SDLC**, **updating documentation** happens during the **maintenance phase**. Ideally, **documentation** should also be **reviewed periodically** to ensure its **accuracy**.

In this guide you learned that: **Documentation** comes in **three formats: written, guide, or graphical**. **Process documentation** describes **how to complete a task**. **Product documentation** relates to **how a product functions**. The **types of product documentation** include **requirements, design, technical, QA, and user**. And **SOPs** are **written instructions** detailing an **organisation's specific procedure**.
