# 04-011 Summary


*   **Software architecture** functions as a blueprint and represents the importance of good architectural design, capturing early design decisions that influence all subsequent development.

*   **Structured design** breaks down software problems into well-organised smaller solution elements, whilst **behavioural models** describe system behaviour without explaining implementation details.

*   **UML diagrams** save time and money by helping developers quickly understand projects, plan features before coding, and navigate source code easily. Types include **state transition**, **interaction**, and **class diagrams**.

*   **Objects** contain data and behaviours (actions the object can take), whereas **classes** are blueprints for creating objects.

*   **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)** comprises loosely coupled services interfacing via communication protocols over networks. **Distributed systems** run multiple services on different machines yet appear to end-users as a single coherent system.

*   **Architectural patterns** are repeatable solutions to architectural problems. Types include **2-tier**, **3-tier**, **event-driven**, **peer-to-peer**, and **microservices**. Two or more patterns can combine in a single system, though some are mutually exclusive.

*   **Application environments** include:
    - **Development:** Active coding platform
    - **Testing/QA:** Component and functionality testing
    - **Staging:** Production-like environment for final validation
    - **Production:** Live environment for all end-users

*   **Production environments** are more complex than pre-production, requiring consideration of non-functional requirements including load, security, reliability, and scalability.

*   **Deployment options** include on-premises (traditional hardware) or cloud platforms (public, private, or hybrid models).


*   **Production infrastructure components** include:
    - **Firewall:** Security monitoring and traffic control
    - **Load balancer:** Traffic distribution across servers
    - **Web servers:** Content delivery (pages, files, images, videos)
    - **Application servers:** Business logic execution
    - **Proxy servers:** Request routing and network optimisation
    - **Database servers:** Data storage and management
