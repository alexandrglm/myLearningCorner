# 03-012: Module 3 Summary

### Programming Language Categories

**Interpreted languages**: Create source code running through an interpreter built into your operating system or web browser.

**Compiled languages**: Create executable files grouped in programs on your computer or device.

### Language Levels

**High-level languages**: Query languages, structured programming languages, object-oriented programming languages.

**Low-level languages**: Assembly languages.

## Code Organization Methods

**Two main approaches**:

1. **Flowcharts**: Pictorial representations of algorithms showing visual process flow
2. **Pseudocode**: Explanation of the function of each line of a program

---

## Fundamental Programming Concepts

### Identifiers

**Purpose**: Reference program components.

**Types**:
- **Constants**: Data items whose values do not change within a program
- **Variables**: Data items whose values can change during program execution

### Functions

**Definition**: Piece of structured, stand-alone, and reusable code performing a single specific action.

**Benefit**: Enables modular programming and code reusability.

### Object-Oriented Programming

**Paradigm**: Programming methodology based on **objects**.

**Structure**: Objects contain:
- **Data** (through attributes/properties)
- **Behaviour** (through methods/functions)

---

## Bottom Line

Modern programming combines **interpreted and compiled languages**, uses **high-level abstractions** for development, organises code through **flowcharts and pseudocode**, and leverages **identifiers, functions, and objects** to create structured, reusable, maintainable software systems.
