# 05-002 Software Engineer Day-to-Day Work Example


### Real-World Software Engineer Day-to-Day Activities

A typical day for a software engineer encompasses multiple dimensions of professional work, combining technical development, collaboration, learning, and problem-solving within an organisational context.

### Morning Routine and Code Review

Engineers begin by reviewing communications and calendar commitments. **Code reviews** form an essential daily activity where colleagues provide feedback on submitted code through merge requests. Mentorship relationships facilitate guidance on code optimisation and improvement opportunities.

### Daily Standup Meetings

**Standup meetings** are brief team synchronisation sessions where each member reports:
- Accomplishments from previous day
- Current work priorities
- Ongoing challenges or blockers

These meetings enable knowledge sharing and allow mentors to provide real-time advice on technical approaches and code optimisation strategies.

### Focus Time and Code Optimisation

Engineers dedicate uninterrupted time to concentrated project work. Activities include:
- Implementing feedback from code reviews
- Re-engineering code for performance improvement
- Using analysis software to measure and validate performance gains
- Submitting revised code for additional feedback

### Cross-Departmental Collaboration

Software engineers work with non-technical departments (marketing, business) to understand requirements.   

**Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** development involves creating functional prototypes with core features for user testing and feedback gathering.

### Skill Development and Learning

Engineers engage in continuous learning through:

- **On-the-job learning:** Tackling unfamiliar technologies whilst contributing meaningfully to projects
- **Technical research:** Reviewing documentation, watching tutorials, reading technical blogs
- **Peer mentorship:** Learning from experienced colleagues' solutions and design approaches
- **Knowledge sharing:** Accessing existing codebases (e.g., previous front-end implementations) for design inspiration and reusability

### Bug Fixes and Quality Assurance

Engineers investigate bug reports, identify root causes, and implement fixes. **Test case development and execution** validates that fixes resolve issues and maintain existing functionality.

### Feedback Culture and Professional Growth

Regular feedback from senior team members provides alternative problem-solving approaches and encourages continuous improvement. This iterative feedback loop accelerates skill development and code quality enhancement.

### Work-Life Integration

Professional enthusiasm extends beyond work hours, with engineers maintaining conceptual engagement with problems, planning implementations, and maintaining intellectual momentum about upcoming tasks.

## Lesson Speech

Hi, I'm **Shelly** and I work as a **Software Engineer for a start-up company in North Carolina**. **When I arrive at work in the morning, I spend some time catching up on my messages and checking my calendar for the day.** Before heading to my **daily standup meeting**, I quickly check the status of my **code merge request from yesterday**. **Great, it's got positive feedback from others in the team and some suggestions from my mentor about improvements I could make.** I'll work on those later.

**During our daily standup meeting, each member of the team talks about what they achieved yesterday and what they're working on today.** **Jonathan, my mentor, gives me some more advice about how I can optimise the code I wrote yesterday.**

**After the meeting, I return to my desk excited to implement the feedback I've received and continue working on my code.** **Now it's focus time, when I can concentrate purely on my project work.** **I use Jonathan's comments on the merge request alongside the notes that I made during our standup to re-engineer a couple of methods to run faster.** **I also use some of our analysis software to compare timings with the previous version** and, **when I'm satisfied that there's a marked improvement, I submit a new merge request to gather additional feedback.** **I then send Jonathan a message to ask if he can review it later today.**

**After lunch, I'm invited to a meeting where the marketing department explains that they need a new feature to monitor the effectiveness of their campaigns.** **One of the senior software engineers, Marie, mentions that she's previously developed a React-based front-end for a management dashboard that we could easily reuse.** **I'm tasked with creating a minimum viable product (MVP) for a small team in the marketing department to trial and provide feedback on.** **I've not used React before, but this is a great chance to get some hands-on experience with it while still making a contribution to the team.** **Learning on the job and developing new skills is an important part of a Software Engineer's role.**

**On my return from the meeting, I find that Jonathan has reviewed my code and approved the merge request.** **He's impressed with the speed of the code and with my coding style.** **It's really helpful to get regular feedback from more experienced members of the team who can suggest alternative ways of solving problems.** **I've also received a bug report notification for one of the features I was working on last week.**

**When I review the full report, I quickly spot the mistake and begin fixing it.** **To check that the fix and the original functionality work as expected, I develop and run a test case for the feature.** **It passes, so I submit a merge request for my fix and resolve the bug.** **Now I'm free to start researching React.** **I spend the rest of the afternoon reviewing the React documentation, watching videos, and reading blogs to give me an overview of React.** **I then contact Marie to ask for access to the front-end she developed so I can review the existing solution.** **This gives me design ideas and inspires me to start planning my dashboard.**

**On my cycle home, my head is buzzing with thoughts about how the new dashboard will look and the functionality I can provide through it.** **Tomorrow can't come quickly enough!**
