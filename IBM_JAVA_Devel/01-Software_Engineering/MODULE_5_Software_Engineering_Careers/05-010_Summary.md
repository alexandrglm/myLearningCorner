# 05-011 Summary


**Software engineers** design and develop software solutions whilst maintaining and updating existing software. The role encompasses technical development, collaborative communication, and continuous problem-solving.

**On-the-job learning** is fundamental to software engineering. Engineers encounter new technologies, frameworks, and methodologies throughout their careers, requiring continuous skill acquisition and adaptation.

**Hard and soft skills** combination is essential. Hard skills (programming, testing, debugging, deployment) provide technical foundation, whilst soft skills (teamwork, communication, problem-solving, adaptability, openness to feedback) enable professional effectiveness and career advancement.

**High demand** characterises the software engineering job market. Growth projections exceed 22% through 2030, with approximately 200,000 annual openings in the United States alone. Roles span diverse industries and offer flexible, satisfying work conditions with competitive compensation (averaging $110,000 USD annually in the USA).

**Career progression** typically follows technical or management paths:  

-   **Technical path:** Junior → Software Engineer → Senior Engineer → Staff Engineer → Principal Engineer/Architect
-   **Management path:** Junior → Software Engineer → Senior Engineer → Technical Lead → Engineering Manager → Director of Engineering → CTO


However, software engineering skills transfer to alternative roles including technical sales, data engineering, database administration, and quality assurance, providing career flexibility.


**Specialised job titles** reflect sub-domains within software engineering:
-   **Front-end engineer:** UI/UX development
-   **Back-end engineer:** Business logic and infrastructure
-   **Full-stack engineer:** Complete application development
-   **DevOps engineer:** Development-operations integration
-   **QA engineer:** Testing and quality assurance
-   **Security engineer:** Vulnerability identification and remediation
-   **Mobile app developer:** Cross-platform mobile solutions
-   **Games developer:** Gaming software creation
-   **Integration engineer:** Hardware-software integration

Each role requires specific technical skills and domain knowledge.


**Software Engineering Code of Ethics** provides professional accountability framework with eight foundational principles:

1.  **Public:** Prioritising public good; responsibility for safety, fairness, accessibility, integrity
2.  **Client/Employer:** Acting in best interests; honesty regarding unethical actions; confidentiality
3.  **Product:** Balancing quality, cost, and timelines
4.  **Judgement:** Integrity, objectivity, avoiding conflicts of interest
5.  **Management:** Risk minimisation, fair compensation, intellectual property protection
6.  **Profession:** Protecting professional reputation; integrity; compliance advocacy
7.  **Colleagues:** Respect, fairness, collaboration, proper attribution
8.  **Self:** Lifelong learning, professional development, quality commitment

The Code supplements but does not replace individual discretion and ethical reasoning in professional decision-making.
