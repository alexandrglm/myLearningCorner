##  Viewpoints: Advice to Women in Software Engineering

---

> I think recently, **there have been a lot of good positive momentum, and diversification of the industry** and **making software engineering a more welcoming place for women in general.**
>
> So, I come from work environments that are you know, primarily women. And now I'm in a work environment that is primarily men. I think I've had a pretty good experience with my coworkers personally. But **in the beginning, it did very much feel like a little bit kind of like you're alone because you know, you're either the only or one of two or three women on your team.**
>
> **I would say just remind yourself that you actually do deserve to be there.** **You actually do belong.** **You do belong there, and everybody started exactly where you are.** **Everybody who started as an engineer and even at your company started and was like I do not know what's going on.** But **you're capable and you'll figure it out.**

---

> **If you're a software developer at a company, your main job should be software development.** And **if your bosses or management or other people in the company want you to do other types of work, you should be getting compensated for it.** **You should have a title that reflects what it is that you do.**
>
> And **I have seen this happen a lot where the woman on the team will be the one who cares about diversity, for instance.** And so **as part of diversity workshops and clubs at the company** and **is participating in diverse hiring events and doing all sorts of like extra training around that side**, then **review time happens.** And **as a software developer, if you're getting reviewed on code, you need to make sure that you're getting enough of that code in your life.** **Everyone needs to contribute. Everyone needs to pull their weight; it can't all go on one person.**

---

> **Join a team that does make you feel like they do support women and want to elevate women and advocate for women.** **So I think it's very fair to ask directly to say, a hiring manager, you know, what is your plan for diversity on your team?** **What types of programs do you or the organisation or company have in place to ensure that women are successful?**
>
> And **you know, be willing and open to speak up if there's something that you think is uncomfortable.** **It's not all on you to fix if something is broken.** **There are other people involved.** And **they also are adults who should be reasonable human beings, and able to take advice and constructive feedback.** **So let them take that advice and constructive feedback.** **You don't have to do all the changing.**

---

> **Never be compelled to join a team where you're not feeling good about it**, or you think that there's a risk that it's not a welcoming. **So ask other people to.** **I think it's very fair to just ask those questions.**
>
> **Don't stay, don't stay, if you don't like it.** **The company needs you more than you need them almost certainly.** **So, leave when you can, if something isn't working out for you—leave.** **You have that ability.**
>
> And **there are companies that have less of that in their culture and less of that in their engineering teams.** **It can feel rough trying to find it sometimes.** But **if you do find yourself at a place that is not a healthy, positive, growing environment for you—leave.** **It doesn't reflect on you, again, it reflects on the company.**

---

> **And I know, any company, or organisation that's even remotely taking diversity and inclusion seriously**, simply with regards to women, **will have programs in place to support women, elevate women.** And you know, **basically, there's an eye on that**, and there as there should be. **There's a lot of effort being put into hiring women and getting women into senior leadership roles, which I think is very important.**
>
> **Figure out what role you want and find free resources to get into those roles.** **One thing to bear in mind is as a woman, you know, we are a minority, and we are underrepresented in the tech industry.** **So, there are a lot of free or low-cost programs tailored specifically to women who want to get into computing** or **women who are in computing looking to advance their careers.**
