# 02-012: Module 2 Summary

### Web Architecture and Communication

**Websites** operate through client-server communication, with browsers requesting data via URLs and servers responding with **HTML** (structure), **CSS** (styling), and **JavaScript** (interactivity). Websites combine **static elements** (pre-stored) and **dynamic elements** (generated on request) to enhance user experience.

**Cloud applications** function similarly but leverage **cloud-based infrastructure**, making them highly **scalable and resilient**.

### Front-End Development

**Front-end technologies** work collaboratively to create **reactive and responsive websites**. **HTML** establishes structure; **CSS** provides styling and cross-browser compatibility; **JavaScript** adds interactivity.

Modern **stylesheet languages** (**SASS**, **LESS**) streamline styling processes. **Responsive design** automatically adapts to devices, whilst **adaptive design** provides device-specific versions. **JavaScript frameworks** (**Angular**, **React.js**, **Vue.js**) enable efficient component-based development.

### Back-End Development

**Back-end development** encompasses extensive technologies including **business logic**, **authentication and authorisation**, **secure data handling**, and **database access**. **APIs**, **routes**, and **endpoints** facilitate front-end and back-end communication.

**Popular back-end languages and frameworks** include **JavaScript** with **Node.js** and **Express**, **Python** with **Django** and **Flask**, and **Java** with the **Spring framework**.

### Teamwork Benefits

**Effective teamwork** produces **improved code quality** with **fewer bugs**, **better-skilled team members**, and **reduced stress**. **Communication**, trust, respect, clear goal definition, and role clarity form the foundation of successful collaboration.

**Squads** in Agile environments comprise up to 10 developers including squad leaders, engineers, and optional UX designers.

### Pair Programming

**Pair programming** enables two developers to work collaboratively, fostering **knowledge and skill sharing** with **superior solutions** and **improved efficiency**. **Driver/Navigator**, **Ping-pong**, and **Strong style** approaches serve different scenarios. Benefits include real-time feedback, enhanced technical and soft skills, and reduced bugs. Challenges encompass mental fatigue, schedule conflicts, personality incompatibility, and potential role imbalance.

### Development Tools

**Version control** (**Git**, **GitHub**) tracks changes, enables collaboration, and facilitates code reversion. **Code libraries** provide reusable functionality; **frameworks** establish standardised application structures.

**CI/CD** practices ensure code quality and frequent, reliable deployments through continuous integration and continuous delivery. **Build tools** automate compilation, testing, and packaging. **Package managers** distribute software across platforms.

### Software Stacks

A **software stack** combines technologies for creating applications and solutions, ranging from simple three-layer systems (presentation, business logic, data) to complex multi-layer architectures.

**Common stacks** include:
- **LAMP**: Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP (open-source, mature, relational data)
- **MEAN**: MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, Node.js (JavaScript-based, platform-agnostic)
- **MERN**: MEAN variant with React (improved performance)
- **MEVN**: MEAN variant with Vue.js (lighter-weight)
- **Python-Django**: Open-source, large-scale applications
- **Ruby on Rails**: Rapid development framework
- **ASP.NET**: Microsoft-integrated technologies

Each stack offers distinct advantages and limitations regarding scalability, language consistency, flexibility, and data handling capabilities.
