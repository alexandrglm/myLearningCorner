# 03-009 MODULE 3 Summary

## Conditional Statements

**Conditional statements direct program flow based on conditions.**

- **`if` statement:** Executes code if a condition is true
- **`if-else` statement:** Provides an alternative action if a condition is false
- **`switch` statement:** Compares a single variable against multiple values
- **Nested conditional statements:** Allow complex decision-making

---

## Loops

**Loops execute code repeatedly based on a condition.**

- **`for` loop:** Used when the number of iterations is known beforehand
- **`while` loop:** Used when the number of iterations is unknown
- **`do-while` loop:** Executes at least once before checking the condition
- **Nested loops:** Useful for multi-dimensional data structures
- **`break` statement:** Immediately terminates a loop
- **`continue` statement:** Skips the current iteration and moves to the next

## Strings

**Strings are sequences of characters, including spaces and punctuation.**

### Common String Methods

- **`length()`** – Returns the number of characters
- **`charAt()`** – Retrieves a character at a specific index
- **`concat()` or `+`** – Used for concatenation
- **`equals()`** – Compares two strings for identical content
- **`substring()`** – Extracts a part of a string
- **`split()`** – Divides a string into smaller pieces
- **`String.join()`** – Combines strings with a separator
- **`toUpperCase()`** – Converts to uppercase
- **`toLowerCase()`** – Converts to lowercase
- **`trim()`** – Removes leading and trailing whitespace

### String Immutability

**Immutability:** Modifying a string creates a new one, leaving the original unchanged.

## Packages and Imports

**Packages organise related classes and interfaces into namespaces.**

- **Created using the `package` keyword**
- **`import` statement:** Includes classes or entire packages
- **Common Java packages:** `java.lang`, `java.util`, `java.io`, `java.net`, `java.sql`, `java.time`

### Benefits of Packages

- Organisation of code
- Prevention of naming conflicts
- Access control
- Efficient file management in large-scale applications

## Functions and Methods

**Functions and methods perform specific tasks in Java.**

- **Function:** A standalone block of code that performs a specific task
- **Method:** A function tied to a class and operates on objects of that class

### Method Characteristics

- Defined with a return type, name, parameters, and code block
- Can access instance variables and other methods
- Support overloading (multiple methods with the same name but different parameters)
- Can be `static` (no instantiation required) or instance methods
- Have different access levels (`public`, `private`, `protected`)
