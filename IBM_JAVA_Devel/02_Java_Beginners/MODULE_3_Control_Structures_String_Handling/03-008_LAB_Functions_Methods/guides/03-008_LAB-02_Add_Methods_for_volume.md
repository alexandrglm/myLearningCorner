# 03-008 LAB 02 - Practice Exercise: Add Volume Methods

## Exercise

Add methods to calculate the volume of:

1. **Sphere** – Volume = `(4/3) × π × r³` where `r` is the radius
2. **Cube** – Volume = `a³` where `a` is the side length
3. **Cuboid** – Volume = `length × breadth × height`

## Tasks

- Create three new `private static` methods in the `AreaCalculator` class
- Each method should take appropriate parameters
- Each method should return a `float` value
- Integrate these methods into the menu system in the `main` method
- Test the program with various inputs
