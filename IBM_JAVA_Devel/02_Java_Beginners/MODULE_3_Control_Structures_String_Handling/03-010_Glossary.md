| Method | A block of code that performs a specific task in a class. |
| Method signature | The combination of a method name and parameter list that defines a method. |
| Module | A feature introduced in Java 9 for better dependency management. |
| `new` | A keyword used to create a new object explicitly. |
| Object | An instance of a class containing state and behaviour. |
| `Optional` | A container object introduced in Java 8 to handle `null` values safely. |
| `OutputStream` | A class used for writing byte streams. |
| Overloading | The process of defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. |
| Package | A namespace that groups related classes together. |
| Parameters | The inputs provided to a function or method. |
| Polymorphism | The ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class. |
| Record | A compact class type introduced in Java 14 for immutable data storage. |
| Recursion | A technique where a method calls itself. |
| Reflection | A feature allowing inspection and modification of classes at runtime. |
| `replace()` | A method that replaces a character or substring with another value. |
| REST (Representational State Transfer) | A web service architecture that uses HTTP requests for communication. |
| Return type | The data type of the value returned by a function or method. |
| Scope | The accessibility of a variable or method within a programme. |
| Serialization | The process of converting an object into a byte stream. |
| `split()` | A method that divides a `String` into parts based on a delimiter. |
| `static` | A keyword used to define class-level methods and variables. |
| Static method | A method that belongs to a class rather than an instance and can be called without creating an object. |
| Stream | A sequence of elements supporting functional-style operations. |
| `String` | A sequence of characters used to represent text in Java. |
