## What is Commercial Java?

Commercial Java refers to proprietary versions of Java, typically offered by companies such as Oracle. These versions have additional features, professional support, and services not found in open-source alternatives. For example, Oracle's Java SE provides comprehensive tools for developing desktop and server-side applications.

## What is Open-Source Java?

Open-source Java refers to freely available versions of Java that anyone can modify and distribute. The most prominent implementation is OpenJDK, the official reference for Java SE.

### Advantages of Open-Source Java

Since open-source Java is free to use, it offers different advantages:

- **Cost-effective:** It's free to use, ideal for startups and developers with limited budgets.

- **Community Support:** Open-source Java has active forums, tutorials, and collaborative resources from the community.

- **Customization:** Developers can edit, alter, and modify the source code to suit specific needs, offering more flexibility.
