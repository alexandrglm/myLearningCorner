# 01-011    Summary for MODULE 1

In this module, you’ll explore Java’s history, evolution, and enduring relevance in programming.    
Next, you will learn how to install and configure Java. You will know how Java Development Kit (JDK), Java Runtime Environment (JRE), and Java Virtual Machine (JVM) fit into your coding practices.   
You will write, compile, and run your first Java program.   
You’ll learn about how Java’s garbage collection manages memory. You’ll also explore other Java features, compare commercial and open-source options, and discover its ecosystem of tools and libraries.

## Summary

-   Java is a versatile programming language used in web apps, mobile apps, enterprise software, cloud-native, and microservices-based development.

-   It runs on any system with Java support, as the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) converts Java bytecode into machine code.

-   The Java Development Kit (JDK) includes Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and development tools for building, compiling, and running Java applications.

-   The JRE provides the JVM and core libraries for executing Java applications but lacks development tools like compilers.

-   Java follows object-oriented programming, organizing code into objects for better management.

-   It enforces strong typing, ensuring strict type checks during compilation.

-   It supports multithreading, allowing multiple processes to run simultaneously.

-   Automatic memory management handles memory allocation and garbage collection.

-   Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) provide comprehensive tools for software development.

-   Frameworks facilitate code reuse and accelerate development.

-   Build tools automate compiling code, managing dependencies, and packaging applications.

-   Application servers provide environments for deploying and managing Java applications.

-   Testing frameworks ensure application functionality through robust testing tools.

-   The Java ecosystem supports desktop and mobile applications, as well as development frameworks using key technologies.

-   Java includes built-in security features to protect against security risks.

-   Its comprehensive standard library provides built-in tools for common tasks.

-   The features of Java include object-oriented programming, platform independence, strong typing, automatic memory management, multithreading, a comprehensive standard library, built-in security features, and versatility across domains.
