## Java: History & Evolution

---

### What Is Java?

**Java** is a high-level programming language enabling developers to build applications that run on almost any platform.   

Its defining characteristic is captured by the phrase:
> **"Write once, run anywhere" (WORA)**—once a Java programme is written, it requires no rewriting for different platforms or devices.

Java applications execute seamlessly on computers, phones, and tablets without modification.

### Java's History and Timeline

| Year | Milestone | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **1991** | Oak created at Sun Microsystems | Early embedded system focus |
| **1995** | Renamed to **Java**, v1.0 released | Rapid adoption |
| **1998** | Java 2 released | Introduced Swing & Collections |
| **1999** | J2EE introduced | Enterprise-scale development |
| **2006** | Made **open source** | Global community expansion |
| **2010** | Oracle acquires Java | Structured version releases |

**1991:**   James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems developed a programming language called **Oak**, initially intended for devices like televisions and guide recorders. Oak's potential for web development was later recognised.

**1995:**   Oak was renamed **Java**, inspired by Java Coffee from Indonesia. Java 1.0 launched officially, gaining rapid popularity due to emphasis on ease of learning and strong security focus.

**1998:**   **Java 2** released, introducing:
-   **Swing:** Framework for building graphical user interfaces
-   **Collections Framework:** More efficient management of object groups

**1999:**   **Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE)** launched, simplifying large-scale business application development through enterprise-specific tools and frameworks.

**2006:**   Sun Microsystems made Java **open source**, enabling worldwide developer contributions and fostering global community improvement. This catalysed creation of numerous libraries, extending Java's functionality.

**2010:**   **Oracle Corporation** acquired Sun Microsystems, assuming Java development control and introducing consistent updates and new features.
