## Course Outline

This course consists of **five modules**.

### Module 1: Introduction to the Java Environment and Ecosystem

This module explores **Java's history, evolution, and relevance in programming.** You will learn how to install and configure Java and understand how the **Java Development Kit (JDK), Java Runtime Environment (JRE), and Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** fit into coding practices. 

You will:
-   Write, compile, and run your first Java programme
-   Explore how Java's garbage collection manages memory
-   Examine key Java features
-   Compare commercial and open-source options
-   Explore its ecosystem of tools and libraries

### Module 2: Basic Programming Constructs in Java

This module introduces **fundamental Java programming concepts**, focusing on:
-   Basic syntax
-   Data types
-   Control structures
-   String handling

You will practice working with **data types and arrays** to solve practical problems.

### Module 3: Control Structures and String Handling

This module explores **functions, methods, and control structures in Java.** You will learn how to:
-   Use conditional and switch statements to control programme flow
-   Apply string-handling techniques
-   Optimise logic using loops

### Module 4: Robust Exception Handling

This module focuses on **Java's exception handling mechanism.** You will learn to:
-   Use try-catch blocks
-   Implement custom exceptions
-   Handle errors effectively

### Module 5: Final Project and Course Wrap-Up

In this final module, **you will apply your Java skills to develop a grocery store calculator application.** 

You will use **operators, data types, loops, conditional statements, and arrays** to design a **command-line-based calculator** that allows users to:
