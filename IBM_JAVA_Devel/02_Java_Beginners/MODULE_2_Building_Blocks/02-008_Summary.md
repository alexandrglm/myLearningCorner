# 02-008 MODULE 2 Summary

## Comments

**Comments serve as notes within the code that are not executed by the program.**

The three types of comments are:

-   Single-line comments `// Comments`
-   Multi-line comments `/*  */`
-   Documentation comments `/** */`

Comments enhance:
-   Clarity
-   Maintenance
-   Collaboration

---

## Packages

**Packages group related classes and interfaces together, improving code organisation.**

---

## Data Types

**Data types are containers for specific types of information:**

-   **Primitive data types** have a fixed size and a default initial value

-   **Reference data types** use memory addresses to locate data and support more complex structures

---

## Operators

**Operators instruct the Java compiler to perform mathematical or logical operations.**

Types of operators include:

-   **Arithmetic operators:** Perform basic arithmetic operations
-   **Relational operators:** Compare two values
-   **Logical operators:** Combine Boolean expressions
-   **Bitwise operators:** Work with binary data
-   **Shift operators:** Manipulate bits in numbers
-   **Assignment operators:** Assign values to variables
-   **Unary operators:** Operate on a single operand
-   **Ternary operator:** Provides a shorthand for conditional statements

---

## Arrays

**Arrays are collections of elements of the same type stored in contiguous memory.**

The process for creating and using an array includes:

-   Array declaration
-   Initialisation
-   Accessing elements
- Iteration using loops

## Best Practices for Code Organisation

-   Use meaningful names for variables, classes, and methods
-   Keep code organised and well-structured
-   Provide clear, concise comments
-   Maintain consistent formatting throughout the code
-   Understand the flow of code execution to ensure logical progression

---

## Module Overview

This module introduces fundamental Java programming concepts, focusing on basic syntax, data types, control structures, and string handling.  

You'll practise working with data types and arrays, then experience applying arrays and functions to solve practical problems.


### Learning Outcomes


-   Identify and describe the basic syntax and structure of Java code, including comments, data types, and operators

-   Differentiate between various data types and control structures and their appropriate applications in programming scenarios  

-   Demonstrate the use of variables and statements through practical lab exercises

-   Develop simple Java programs that utilise arrays to solve specific problems
