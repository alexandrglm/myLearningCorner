# 02-009 Glossary

## MODULE 2: Building Blocks of Java Programming

This alphabetised glossary contains many terms used in this module. Understanding these terms is essential when working in the industry, participating in user groups, and participating in other certificate programmes.

---

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Abstract class | A class that cannot be instantiated and is meant to be subclassed. |
| Abstraction | The concept of hiding implementation details and exposing only essential features. |
| `ArrayList` | A resizable implementation of the `List` interface in Java. |
| `break` statement | A statement that exits a loop or `switch` statement immediately. |
| `catch` block | A block of code that handles exceptions thrown in a `try` block. |
| `charAt()` method | A method that returns the character at a specific index in a `String`. |
| Checked exception | An exception that must be handled using `try-catch` or declared using `throws`. |
| Child class | A class that inherits from another class. |
| Clarity | A benefit of comments that clarify complex logic, making it easier to understand. |
| Class | A blueprint for creating objects, containing attributes and methods that define behaviours. |
| Class attribute | A variable that is declared within a class and used to store object data. |
| Collaboration | A benefit of comments that helps team members understand each other's work in a team environment. |
| Comment | A note in the code that is not executed by the program and is used to explain, clarify, or annotate parts of the code for developers. |
| Constructor | A special method in a class that initialises new objects. |
| `continue` statement | A statement that skips the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next one. |
| Documentation comment | A comment that is used for generating documentation using tools such as Javadoc. |
| `do-while` loop | A loop that executes at least once before checking the condition. |
| Encapsulation | A principle of restricting access to certain details of a class and exposing only necessary parts. |
| Entry point | A starting method of a Java application, typically the `main` method. |
| `equals()` method | A method that compares the values of two `String`s or objects for equality. |
| Exception | An event that disrupts the normal flow of a program. |
| `extends` keyword | A keyword used by a class to indicate that it is inheriting from another class. |
| `final` keyword | A keyword used to declare constants, prevent method overriding, or prevent inheritance. |
| Folder structure for packages | A directory structure on the filesystem that should match the package declaration. |
| `for` loop | A loop that executes a block of code a specific number of times. |
| Garbage collection | A process by which Java automatically deallocates unused objects to free memory. |
| `implements` keyword | A keyword used by a class to indicate that it is implementing an interface. |
| `import` statement | A statement that is used to include classes from other packages in a Java source file. |
| Inheritance | A process by which a class acquires properties and methods of another class. |
| Interface | A collection of abstract methods that a class can implement. |
| `length()` method | A method that returns the length of a `String` or an array. |
| `List` | An ordered collection that allows duplicate elements and provides indexed access. |
| Main class | A class in a Java application that contains the `main` method, serving as the entry point. |
| Maintenance | A benefit of comments that provides context, making it easier to understand the code when revisiting it later. |
| `Math` class | A class in Java that provides mathematical functions such as `sqrt()`, `pow()`, and `abs()`. |
| Method | A function that is defined inside a class and performs a specific action. |
| Method signature | A unique identifier of a method, consisting of its name and parameter list. |
| Multi-line comment | A comment that spans multiple lines. |
| `nextInt()` method | A method that reads an integer input using `Scanner`. |
| `nextLine()` method | A method that reads an entire line of input using `Scanner`. |
| `null` keyword | A keyword that represents an absence of value in an object reference. |
| Object | An instance of a class that represents a specific entity with attributes and behaviours. |
| Object instantiation | A process of creating an instance of a class using the `new` keyword. |
| Overloading | A process of defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. |
| Override | A process of defining a method in a subclass that replaces a method in the parent class. |
| Package | A way to group related classes and interfaces together to avoid naming conflicts and manage large projects. |
| Package declaration | A statement that uses the `package` keyword at the top of a Java source file to define a package. |
| Parameter | A variable passed into a method to provide input values. |
| Parent class | A class that is extended by another class in inheritance. |
| `parseDouble()` method | A method that converts a `String` to a `double`. |
| `parseInt()` method | A method that converts a `String` to an `int`. |
| Polymorphism | A concept that allows an object to take on multiple forms, usually through method overriding and overloading. |
| `private` access modifier | A modifier that restricts access to a class member so it can only be accessed within the same class. |
| `public` access modifier | A modifier that allows a class, method, or variable to be accessible from anywhere in the application. |
| `Random` class | A class that is used to generate random numbers. |
| `replace()` method | A method that replaces occurrences of a substring within a `String`. |
| Return type | A data type of the value that a method returns. |
| `Scanner` class | A class that is used to take input from the user. |
| Single-line comment | A comment that starts and applies only to the text following it on that line. |
| Source file naming | A rule that states each public class should be in its own source file, named exactly after the class with a `.java` extension. |
| `split()` method | A method that splits a `String` into an array based on a given delimiter. |
| `static` method | A method that belongs to a class rather than an instance and can be called without creating an object. |
| `static` variable | A variable that belongs to a class rather than any specific instance. |
| `String` | A sequence of characters that represents textual data. |
| `substring()` method | A method that extracts a portion of a `String` based on the given indexes. |
| `super` keyword | A keyword that is used to refer to the parent class of the current object. |
| `System.out.println()` | A method that is used to print output to the console. |
| `this` keyword | A keyword that is used to reference the current instance of a class. |
| `throw` keyword | A keyword that is used to manually raise an exception. |
| `throws` keyword | A keyword that is used in a method signature to declare that the method may throw exceptions. |
| `toLowerCase()` method | A method that converts a `String` to lowercase. |
| `toUpperCase()` method | A method that converts a `String` to uppercase. |
| `try` block | A block of code where exceptions are checked. |
| Unchecked exception | An exception that does not require explicit handling. |
| `while` loop | A loop that continues executing as long as a condition is true. |
