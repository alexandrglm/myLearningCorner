## Video Lesson Speech

\[ENG]

**Jordan Hudgens:** In this guide we're going to learn\
what a sitemap is and how to construct one. We'll talk about some of the\
goals you should have when you're building one and how you can\
translate those into building the user experience. We'll also discuss\
providing the sitemap to your developers so that they know what screens\
to build.

**Jesse Cook:** _The frame of mind that you should be_\
_in when you approach a sitemap is that it should answer all of the user_\
_stories. We've created all these user stories, so I'm going to create a_\
_separate sitemap for each user. Whatever those user stories are, I_\
_start going through them. Jim needs to be able to message, so I need to_\
_make sure that there is a messaging page. Once I create that page in the_\
_sitemap, I indicate the main unique actions that happen on that page._

_There's a lot of "dealer's choice" here. Most people are going to_\
_build their sitemaps a little bit differently. They're going to use_\
_different programs. I really like Lucidchart because of its team aspect_\
_and that you can have multiple people participate on it. Then it becomes_\
_about how you indicate what a page is, and what actions are._

_Another thing is: how granular do you get? You might think, "OK, I_\
_have all these pages, and I can click 15 things on each one of these_\
_pages." Well, sure, but you don't have to indicate that on every single_\
_page. That's a little too granular. In my opinion, it's not very_\
_productive, because you could click the logo on every single page and_\
_it'll take you to the home page. But I don't need to indicate that on_\
_every single page of my sitemap._

_Here, you can see that there are two main shapes: rectangles and_\
_diamonds. This is my own personal thing. You may be working inside of a_\
_company that already has these conventions established, or you'll be_\
_coming up with them yourself, but I like using rectangles for pages and_\
_diamonds for indicating user actions that solve user stories._

_You can see that these actions either take you to other actions_\
_or to another page. When you map it all out, you should be left with a_\
_picture of all the pages that need to exist and the key actions that can_\
_be taken from each of them. This will really give you a clear idea of_\
_how you're going to solve all of the user stories you've already_\
_created._

**JH:** That's awesome. It's a great example of how\
you've translated user stories directly into something functional that\
you can use.

Now, Jesse, after you've built the sitemap, which stakeholders do you\
meet with and get feedback from? Obviously, I'm assuming the client,\
but do you also take this to the developers? Who else are you connecting\
with?

**JC:** _It'll hit the developers_ after _it's_\
_been approved by the client (or the product owner or whoever is running_\
_that). You'll work through the sitemap with them, with the user stories_\
_right alongside it. A lot of times, clients will get kind of glossy_\
_when they see this. It's not the sexy thing that they see in their mind._\
_But the main thing is that you're saying: here's our list of user_\
_stories for Jim. Jim wants to be able to message. Bam, this is where he_\
_goes to message. What else can he do? He can send a message, he can_\
_receive a message, and he can flag a message, so let's indicate those._\
_What happens after the flags a message? Does he go to another screen?_\
_Does he go to an approval screen, or something else? We can indicate_\
_that. We have our messages screen represented in our sitemap, and we_\
_have an action under it: "flag message." Then we can have an arrow that_\
_takes us to review flagged content, and I can represent that._

_When I get into later phases of the development I'll have a very_\
_clear idea. It's so much better than just taking notes, or even skipping_\
_past it. You might be inclined to say "I've got my user stories, let's_\
_get this done," but this is helping you fill in the gaps so that you_\
_don't have to rework your designs. You don't end up saying, "Oh dang it!_\
_I totally forgot about this entire thing. I've got to go back through_\
_all my designs," because design is a lot harder to manipulate than just_\
_going in and adding rectangles and diamonds._

**JH:** That brings up a great point. We talk about\
stakeholders and how important it is to have this kind of foundation to\
look back at. I remember, for one pretty large-scale application, I had a\
client who was not technical whatsoever. I had already built close to\
half of the application, and, while _**I**_ thought\
it was going well, this client had nothing to look at that he could\
understand. He couldn't go look at my code, the application wasn't ready\
to prototype, and because of that he kept asking for what was\
essentially a sitemap. He wanted to see lines going to boxes to see what\
one user could do and what another couldn't. I ended up having to build\
something like this halfway through the project. If I would've done it\
at the beginning, it would have helped me in my development, but even\
more important is that it would have helped the client understand all\
the processes that were taking place.

**JC:** _Right, right. And obviously, after this has_\
_been approved by the client, you're taking this to team leads, and the_\
_team leads are taking it to the developers. So, regardless of how_\
_interested you are in sitemaps, as a developer you will need to know how_\
_to understand them. And they're not terribly complicated. Of course,_\
_that may also depend on who's creating the sitemap for you, but I don't_\
_like making mine terribly complicated because that's just miserable._

**JH:** Right.

**JC:** _It's important to be able to understand this_\
_because, the better the communication bridge between creative and_\
_development, the smoother every project is going to go. The better you_\
_can understand the sitemaps that are being created, the more valuable_\
_you are as a developer because you won't have to walk through it over_\
_and over and over again. You're going to see holes and all the things we_\
_talked about before, and you'll be able to get a quick picture of the_\
_project and know what's being communicated._

**JH:** Absolutely. I love the tools we have now that we\
didn't have a few years ago. You could see in the example sitemap that\
there are spots for comments. When I was working with the design team on\
this specific diagram they would ask me questions like, "What type of\
functionality are you looking for right here?" when they didn't have all\
the clarification they needed. And that's a great thing, because, not\
only are these tools good for building the sitemap initially, but\
they're also good for collaboration _while_ it's being built. You\
can clear up a lot of mistakes in the very beginning by being able to\
communicate properly with all the stakeholders.

**JC:** _Right! I definitely get pinged every once in_\
_awhile by developers asking, "What is going on here? What is this page?_\
_Where did this come from?" It's really nice when you don't have to cut_\
_through anything, you can just go right to the question and you're all_\
_on the same page really quickly._
