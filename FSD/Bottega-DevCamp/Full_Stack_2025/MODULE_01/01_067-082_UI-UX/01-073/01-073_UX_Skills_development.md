**Jordan Hudgens:** We haven't\
gotten into how you can practice these things and improve as a UX\
developer. Jesse has a lot of experience in this and is definitely one\
of the most talented UX/UI guys I've ever had the pleasure of working\
with.

I want to get your opinion on how you've improved. I know you were probably born with _some_ innate talent, but I think you have probably developed it because of\
how hard you've worked and the different steps you take each day to\
improve.

**Jesse Cook:** _I think that developers sometimes_\
_are a little spooked when the letters "UI/UX" come flying around. But,_\
_honestly, UX is a very similar skillset to development. Lots of critical_\
_thinking and things like that. However, I want to start with what I_\
_believe is the most important part of being a good experience designer,_\
_and that's communication._

_Improving your ability to communicate is what allows you to get_\
_the information from the client. Most of what I do all day is talk. I'm_\
_talking to clients and working through problems with them and then_\
_communicating those things to my developers and team leads._\
_Communication is so important in all of this. Of the software projects_\
_I've been a part of, communication was the difference between the ones_\
_that went well and the ones that went poorly. If there is one thing I_\
_could point, to that was it. I mean, I'm sure you've noticed that._

**JH:** Absolutely. That's one thing I do like about the\
entire study of user experience is that it's communication on the goal\
of the system and what you want it to do, and explaining that in a\
visual format. It's saying, "These are the ways that the user should\
interact with this entire application," and, by visually placing it\
there, that gives developers like myself the ability to run with it.\
Whenever I'm trying to do this by myself, I always run into these\
stumbling blocks. I spend half my time just trying to figure out "So\
where should I put this button?" and then it ends up being wrong. That's\
where developing those critical thinking skills and practicing them\
really comes in handy so that you can actually improve. You continually\
build those skills.

**JC:** _Right. Think of it as a house. You're_\
_working with a homeowner who's having you build this house, and you're_\
_laying the blueprint for it. They don't know how you're going to do the_\
_electrical or where you're going to put the trusses. They don't know any_\
_of that. But they do know if there needs to be a one-car or two-car_\
_garage. That's something they know, right? That's what you need to_\
_download from the client or the manager. You need to translate that onto_\
_paper, and then you need to be a very good listener and a very good_\
_communicator._

_That's definitely something that I would recommend. You don't_\
_think about becoming a better communicator, but I promise you, it will_\
_help you so much. Whether it's through research or just being an active_\
_participant in those conversations, it helps to ask those questions and_\
_try to root out the things that you don't know that you don't know, or_\
_that you don't know that the_ client _doesn't know. Being honest_\
_about whether you understand something or not. Pretending to know what_\
_they're talking about is just going to bite you over and over and over_\
_again._

_The next thing is the ability to both zoom in and zoom out on the_\
_fly. Don't spend too much time solving little problems in an isolated_\
_environment. Those little problems that you're solving, while good,_\
_might have an effect on the larger project. You might solve a problem on_\
_this one page, but that might affect how that object is going to behave_\
_on mobile or in three pages from now._

**JH:** Right.

**JC:** _So you need to be able to zoom in and solve_\
_little problems, but always be zooming out and asking yourself "Does_\
_this affect other things outside of this one isolated incident?"_

**JH:** Absolutely. That's one of the core concepts\
around critical thinking is being able to have that perspective. Yes,\
you can dive in and see the little details--you can see where that\
button goes or what the navbar looks like--but you also have to zoom\
back out and say "If I build this one feature, or if I structure the\
user experience in this way, how does that affect the mobile experience?\
How does that affect what they're doing on a desktop?" And then, when\
you even have more experience working with developers, or _being_ a developer, then you can understand that there might be other\
ramifications beyond that. You can dream up all you want, but some\
things need to coincide with the system it's being built with.

**JC:** _100% percent. The more you understand about_\
_development--and you said it's called a unicorn for a reason--but if you_\
_are really good at communicating, you have a firm grasp on the_\
_development, you work well with people, and you have some of that design_\
_built into your DNA, it is_ _**so**_ _valuable._\
_When I'm making design decisions, I'm not making decisions based on_\
_what's easier to develop. But if you know what the development_\
_ramifications are, well, holy smokes, you can really optimize that flow._\
_You can gain the most value possible without sacrificing tons of time_\
_in development._

**JH:** Absolutely. We talked a lot about critical\
thinking and developing a mental framework for how to think through\
these problems. Whether it's in the details or being able to take a step\
back and look at it at a higher level, it comes down to just actually\
practicing. When you are building a new application, instead of just\
jumping straight to the coding and building the design as you go, start\
practicing these techniques.

Now, your low fidelity wireframes are not going to look as good as\
Jesse's the first time you do them, but that's where practice comes in.\
Your first one may not be the best-looking one that's out there, but\
your fourth and fifth and fiftieth may be. They are going to continue to\
improve. It's just like any skill. One really big goal of this course\
is trying to make the entire user experience process a little bit less\
magical. If you've been going through this course and you've heard all\
these topics and the very first thing that pops into your mind is that\
most of this is just common sense: You're right. It is.

**JC:** _Haha._

**JH:** And that's the way it should be! If it was any\
other way, then that would be a problem because this entire process is\
all about logic, common sense, and having a systematic approach to\
developing applications. Instead of throwing a blanket over it and\
hoping everything's just going to work, it's thinking about each stage\
of that project's lifecycle right from the beginning through to the end.

**JC:** _Right. And honestly, there's a lot of_\
_different traps that you can get caught up in. One of which is just_\
_thinking that it's easy because it really isn't. When you see an app_\
_that has a good user experience it's like, "Well, duh. Of course, you_\
_would do it that way." But that's not how most people do it! And I'm_\
_sure you've used a lot of apps where you say, "That took me four clicks_\
_to get to and I use that every day! And this other button that I only_\
_click once a month is super prominent!" You just should not notice a_\
_good user experience design. You notice it when it's bad because it_\
_really makes you angry._

**JH:** Haha. Absolutely!

**JC:** _So, when you see an app that looks really_\
_polished and works really well, don't think that they came up with it by_\
_going straight for what was obvious. They got there because they_\
_refined it. They took the steps necessary to fill in those gaps, and_\
_fill in those holes._

**JH:** The point of this course is to give you a mental\
mindset that allows you to perform these same tasks without running\
into some of the issues we've had to fight against through the years.\
It's so that you could learn from our experiences just the same way that\
we try to learn from our own. It's really meant to help build that\
mental framework so that, when you're presented with a project, you\
don't just start trying to code it, but that you build a system for how\
to go and build it.

If you went through our problem-solving course, part of the reason we\
created it was to help you develop a system for when you're given\
something new to build. You may not know how to build the entire system\
right away, but you would at least know what the first step is, which\
would lead you to the second one, and the third. That's why I wanted\
Jesse's design process to be included in this course because it's a\
straightforward approach to planning and then executing an application's\
design.
