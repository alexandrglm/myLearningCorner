## MODULE 01 - 071: Designing Low Fidelity Wireframes

## Video Lesson Speech

\[ENG]

**Jordan Hudgens:** The first time I heard "low fidelity\
wireframe" I had no idea what that was. Give us a high-level\
description of what they are and why you would choose to make one\
instead of something more detailed.

**Jesse Cook:** _Again, this is a "dealer's choice"_\
_kind of thing. Different designers and creative directors might just say_\
_"wireframe", but I like breaking it up into both low and high fidelity_\
_wireframes. The reason is that with a low fidelity wireframe you are_ _**strictly**_ _focusing_\
_on the user experience. It's very easy to get carried away and start to_\
_design things. You're excited, so you're putting all these objects on_\
_there, but the main objective of building low fidelity wireframes is_\
_that you know all of the objects that need to exist on every page. It_\
_doesn't necessarily matter how big the button is, you just need to know_\
_that the button needs to_ be _there._

_So the idea with the low fidelity wireframe is to_ not _be_\
_thinking of the user interface at all. I mean, maybe 5-10% percent, and_\
_saying "I'm going to make a square to mean a button," but that's the_\
_extent of it. The important part is that you're actually saying, "For_\
_these actions to happen, what objects need to exist?" That may include_\
_my nav bar, or some buttons, or a profile picture that's just_\
_represented with a circle or something. It's very very low fidelity._

_This approach forces you to identify the holes. It helps you_\
_figure out things that you hadn't realized while building the sitemap._\
_You might think you've got everything answered once you're done with the_\
_sitemap, and then find that a little more context helps you find some_\
_more problems._

**JH:** Absolutely. For anyone that's gone through our\
UML or Problem Solving course, there are some pretty big areas of\
overlap here. For example, in the UML specification, it's actually a\
requirement that you start with your most high-level, generic things\
first. And that's for the practical reason. You may end up wasting a lot\
of time if you get too detailed over how a button looks, because you\
may find out later on that you don't even need the button at all.

**JH:** I remember the very first time I was ever sent a\
low fidelity wireframe. I was surprised because I usually was getting\
more detailed mockups, like Photoshop screens. They sent me this\
wireframe and it looked _really_ ugly.

**JC:** _Oh yeah._

**JH:** But that's good! That's the way it's supposed to be. Like you mentioned, you don't care about user interface at this point.

**JC:** _Right._

**JH:** You're just trying to get one step closer to the\
goal line and make sure that, when you finally hand it off to the\
developer, they know exactly what they need to build.

**JC:** _Exactly. And it allows some of the backend_\
_tasks to get started while you're doing the high fidelity mockups._\
_Getting that high fidelity design finished can take some time,_\
_especially when you're working with the client. They can get really_\
_picky at that point, so that process can go a little bit slower. But if_\
_you have these low fidelity wireframes, the backend developers can get_\
_started because they know the objects that need to exist. They know the_\
_data that needs to be there. They don't care how it looks, but they have_\
_something that they can start with to build out the app while you're_\
_working on other parts of it._

_And, really, I can't emphasize this enough: the low fidelity_\
_wireframe is so important because it forces you to focus on the user_\
_experience. Even something as simple as Tinder; there are a lot of user_\
_interface pieces to it, but let's take the single user experience_\
_concept of "what's the best way for me to cycle through profiles?" That_\
_gesture kicked off a whole slew of apps using that exact same gesture._\
_It wasn't necessarily a user_ interface _decision. It was saying,_\
_"I'm on this screen and I need to take some sort of action. I don't_\
_want to use a button, so I'm going to use a gesture."_

_This wireframing process forces you to think through those_\
_specific things and say, "Man, there's a lot of stuff on this page, this_\
_is really complicated." or, "Wait a second, how do I know what number_\
_to put in here if I haven't pulled this data from this other screen?"_\
_It's forcing you to think through that page-by-page user flow. At this_\
_point, you'd be wasting your time designing buttons and making_\
_everything balance properly, only to discover that you need 10 more_\
_objects on the page. That's going to affect everything, and that five_\
_hours of design you just did is now worthless because you have to go and_\
_change everything._

_So this forces you to_ _**just**_ _focus_\
_on that single user experience problem and create a nice flow from_\
_screen to screen to screen. You're going to come back and design it, or a_\
_designer is going to design it, but from the user experience standpoint_\
_this part is absolutely critical to get right._

**JH:** Yes. That's one thing I've noticed as a team\
lead on projects. When low fidelity wireframes were used, it automated a\
lot of the other processes for the development team. I used to wait\
until the designer was done with the entire system before I really\
started coding. That was mainly because I'd had many bad experiences\
where I thought they were done, and I would start building it, but then\
I'd have to wipe the slate clean and start from scratch because they had\
changed something very significant. Now, when I work with these types\
of low fidelity wireframes, it gives me a head start. I don't have to\
wait for the designs. I can be confident that a significant portion of\
the user experience in that interaction is accurate. So I can take those\
wireframes and code straight from them. I don't have to worry about the\
design; I know I'll take care of implementing that part whenever the\
high fidelity wireframes are done.

You've mentioned elements such as images, buttons, and even gestures.\
Are there any other types of elements or any other types of actions\
that you try to capture?

**JC:** _Maybe not actions as much as identifying_\
_what data you're pulling in. So, if it's a dashboard, you're saying, "I_\
_need to be able to show this piece of metadata and this piece of_\
_metadata," which helps the backend developer. He doesn't care what it_\
_looks like, just that it needs to be in there._

**JC:** _Take DailySmarty for example. One of the_\
_objects in your wireframe might be a post. On the post index page, what_\
_type of metadata do I need to pull in? Do I need to pull in categories?_\
_Do I need to pull in post author? Do I need to pull in the date? With a_\
_low fidelity wireframe, I can actually show you that you need all this_\
_data here. I don't know how it's going to look, but I can represent it_\
_really quickly. I don't care about font sizes, I don't care about much,_\
_but it gives you a clear idea of the things you need to pull in to_\
_actually start building it._
