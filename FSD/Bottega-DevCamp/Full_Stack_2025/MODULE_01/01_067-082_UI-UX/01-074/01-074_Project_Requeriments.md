## Video Lesson Speech

\[ENG]

Now that you have some of the fundamental knowledge down on building a\
user experience, you're going to get your own hands dirty in building\
your own and you're going to be building your own portfolio application.

**Jordan Hudgens:** This is a\
user experience project. In the User Interface course, we'll get into\
making it actually look good, but in this project, we're simply going to\
focus on the user experience. What we want you to do is go through.

Start with step one, which is the prime objective. Define what the\
prime objective of this system is. It needs to be a little bit more\
specific than "this is a portfolio application." It comes down to what\
you want people to really see and the type of experience you want them\
to have.

**Jesse Cook:** _Whenever doing a marketing_\
_website--and where you're marketing yourself--you'll ask, "What am I_\
_trying to accomplish? Am I selling a product?" Yes. You're selling_\
_yourself. You're the product, so after identifying what the prime_\
_objective is, all your content should be trying to achieve that_\
_objective. With any marketing site, whether it's a purchase, subscribe,_\
_or Contact Me button, these are the things that you want your users to_\
_do, whether they're possible employers, partners, or customers. So,_\
_identify, first, what you want these people to do, and who these people_\
_are, and then make sure everything about this website revolves around_\
_that._

**JH:** The deliverables for this project are a sitemap and a low fidelity wireframe.

The sitemap will show all the pages on your portfolio application, and how users can navigate from one to the other.

With the low fidelity wireframe, it is not going to look the way that\
your final website is actually going to look. Instead, this is going to\
be a high level and focus on navigability and what components will be\
on each page.

**JC:** _The site map should be pretty easy because_\
_you don't have a whole lot of actions, or a lot of pages. As far as_\
_tools, for the sitemap I use Lucidchart. That's really good for teams_\
_but also they have a free trial. Like I said, it's dealer's choice as_\
_far as diagramming conventions._

_For the wireframe tools, I personally use Adobe XD. That's kind_\
_of an expensive program, so a free alternative is InVision, which has_\
_some pretty good features._

**JH:** You can use either a paid application or, if\
you're just starting to get into this, then a free tool like InVision is\
perfectly fine.

If you end up focusing your development career in the UI/UX world\
then you'll most likely be using some of the more expensive and advanced\
tools. But in order to complete this project, you can use completely\
free applications or free trials of those.

**JC:** _If it's a little daunting at first, get a_\
_whiteboard or a piece of paper. If you just want to focus on one thing_\
_at a time, and you don't want to learn a new piece of software then_\
_whiteboard and sketchbooks are great options. I spend a lot of time on_\
_the whiteboard because I might want to quickly sketch out three_\
_different options. You don't have to necessarily dive right into the_\
_deep end. If you're feeling a little bit hesitant or apprehensive then,_\
_absolutely, feel free to try it out._

**JH:** And my best advice for going through this\
project successfully is really to follow the pattern that Jesse's\
outlined. Notice how it started with the most generic, high-level\
concepts such as the overall goal of the system. Then, with each step\
down the creative process, things got more and more detailed. Don't try\
to jump in and build your wireframes right when this video's done.\
Follow the process. Having a good portfolio application is important,\
but the much more important thing is actually learning these skills and\
this workflow so that later on these things become second nature.

**JC:** _When going through this process, identify_\
_the difference between user interface and user experience. For this_\
_part, when you're focusing on user experience, think about the content_\
_that you're going to be putting in there. This is when you're actually_\
_thinking through storytelling. With a marketing site, you're trying to_\
_tell a good story. You're trying to identify what propositions you want_\
_to talk about, and in what order. Think about when you want to slip in_\
_those calls to action. It might change a little when you start putting_\
_it into the design, but during the wireframing, you should be thinking_\
_about the content._

_If there's one piece of advice I can give you it's to keep the_\
_content as small as possible. Have your headlines very direct, be very_\
_precise, and then any supporting smaller text that's underneath it keep_\
_as minimal as possible. You want to communicate in as few words as_\
_possible, especially with an employer. You don't want to waste their_\
_time telling them what your favorite fruit snack was when you were 10._

**JH:** Now, depending on your experience level, you may\
not have knowledge of all of those different components. You may not\
know what your specialty is going to be. That is perfectly fine. I don't\
want that to stop you from going out and building this. Instead, you\
could put something like: "This is what I think my specialty is." It\
could be a full stack developer or a front end developer, but make those\
a focal point. You're not locked into that believe me. You can change\
at any time. I constantly am changing my own portfolio applications

Right now this is all about developing the right system because it's\
one thing to hear it from us. It's a completely different thing when you\
actually get into the weeds and start building out these types of\
sitemaps and wireframes. You're going to find there are some nuances\
that you really can only learn when you're doing it yourself.

Good luck with the project, and we'll see you on the next course!
