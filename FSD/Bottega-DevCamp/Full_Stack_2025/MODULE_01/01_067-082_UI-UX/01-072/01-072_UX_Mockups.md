**Jordan Hudgens:** In this guide\
we're going to discuss high fidelity wireframes, or, "mockups". These\
are much more detailed. They essentially represent what the system will\
look like.

We're not going to go into a lot of detail here, because that's what\
the User Interface course is for. That course teaches you how to create\
these types of mockups, pick the right color schemes, build a style\
guide, and design the rest of the interface. We're not going to cover\
all of that right now. We're simply including this section so you know\
at what stage to build these types of designs.

**Jesse Cook:** _Following the low fidelity_\
_wireframes, you're going to get into these high fidelity designs or_\
_these mockups. Like I said in a previous guide, clients, managers, and_\
_bosses start to get really handsy at this point because this is a really_\
_fun part._

_Generally how I run these projects is that I get sign off on the_\
_sitemap and I get sign off on the low fidelity wireframe so that I'm_\
_confident about what's supposed to be there. Armed with that, I create_\
_just a couple of high fidelity designs of key pages so that I can give_\
_the client a good idea of what the app is going to look like. At this_\
_point, I like to go to the Bat Cave and tell the client "I'm going to_\
_disappear for a little while."_

_Hopefully, by this time, I've established some trust that they_\
_don't need to be involved on every single screen. They know I'm going to_\
_match the aesthetic from that first couple of mockups and that I'm_\
_going to apply that same design to the others. I'm really just putting_\
_the paint on the wireframes. I'm moving things around--maybe I had a_\
_button in the low fidelity wireframe, and I didn't care where it went,_\
_so I just threw it in the middle._

_When I start to design it, there's a domino effect where every_\
_decision is going to affect another decision. That's why we did the low_\
_fidelity wireframe because we don't want one change to affect a bunch of_\
_things that you put a lot of time and effort into. This is the point_\
_where you can start to get really meticulous and start to care about the_\
_balance because you know all the Lego pieces that you're working with._\
_You know when you assemble them that it should stay the way it is. If it_\
_doesn't, then it's probably because you've allowed someone like me to_\
_add some more scope which I tend to do._

**JH:** Haha!

**JC:** _So that's where we flow into this. You want_\
_to make sure that everything leading up to this has been signed_\
_off--don't skip the low fidelity, because when you hit this point you_\
_want to work with confidence and actually put the time into it to make_\
_each one of these things look great._

**JH:** That's perfect.

We wanted to keep this section short since this is what the User\
Interface course is all about. The main takeaway is that, after you have\
the sitemaps and the wireframes approved, and the developers are\
working on the backend, _**that's**_ when you get down to business and start designing mockups, style guides, and so on.
