**What is the difference between UI and UX?**

In digital design, user interface (UI) refers to the interactivity,\
look, and feel of a product screen or web page, while user experience\
(UX) covers a user’s overall experience with the product or website.

#### Defining UI vs UX design

To create engaging UI, designers consider these four key elements:

1. **Page layout**.\
   Ideally, the organization of a web page or mobile app screen should\
   seem intuitive to users. But to organize it that way, UI designers have\
   to make dozens of well-considered decisions—from the header position to\
   the amount of white space.
2. **Color scheme and font selection**.\
   UI designers carefully choose the colors and fonts on a digital product\
   interface for consistency, accessibility, and brand alignment.
3. **Interactive elements.** From [button design](https://www.figma.com/community/file/769870685529936013/Button-UI-%2F-Design-System) to drop-down menus, UI designers style digital product screens to make user flows intuitive.
4. **Wireframe and prototype fidelity.** UX designers often put together basic wireframes and prototypes. UI designers can help transform them into high-fidelity, functional, interactive product mockups .

#### ### Do you really need a UI designer to create UI?

Startups sometimes build a minimum viable product without a dedicated UI\
designer—but there are drawbacks.

_"Graphic designers often own responsibilities for brand alignment, and will help provide some brand guidelines to build UI,"_ \* Hugo says.

_"But graphic designers traditionally focus on static printed design, so they may need to get up to speed on accessibility and responsive design—key skills UI designers bring_\
_to the table."_

#### ## 5 steps to UX design

There's more to UX design than meets the eye on a\
user interface. The UX design process involves market research,\
wireframe development, prototype testing, and cross-functional\
collaboration.

There are five essential steps to successful UX design:

**1. Consumer and competitor research**

To deliver a positive user experience, UX designers need to understand\
their target audience.

Through UX research, they discover what their users like, what problems and pain points they’re facing, and how they behave online or while using an app or software.

UX designers may also perform competitor analysis using a SWOT process to define their product niche.

**2. Information architecture**

Once UX designers understand users’ needs and behaviors, they can create\
information architecture (IA) for their product or site.

Designers use IA as a visual blueprint, outlining essential navigation, content\
hierarchy, features, and interactions.

One key IA tool is a FLOWCHART map, which designers use to map out key user flows and decision points.

IA flowcharts help teams understand at a glance how the product is intended\
to work—and where there's a gap that may require additional features\
or updates.

**3. Wireframes and prototypes**

With IA sketched out, UX designers can start turning ideas into tangible\
models, such as wireframes and prototypes.

Teams use these proofs of concept to test ideas, define requirements, and set feature priorities.

**4. Testing and troubleshooting**

A mockup, a proof of concept, helps UX designers, developers, and product owners see how features will work in practice.

If testing reveals issues like confusing navigation, menus, or forms, the team can adjust them before launch.

**5. Ongoing updates**

Even after a digital product has entered the market, a UX designer’s job is\
never truly done.

With new user feedback and back-end analytics, they can design updates and improvements.

For example, analytics may reveal that an e-commerce checkout process is too long, leading to a high cart abandonment rate. To address this issue, UX designers may streamline some checkout steps.

#### ### How to recognize successful UX design

What does UX success look like? According to Peter Morville, author of _Information Architecture for the World Wide Web_, successful UX answers yes to these [seven user experience questions](https://semanticstudios.com/user_experience_design/):Is the site or product useful?

![IMG](https://semanticstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2004/06/honeycomb.jpg)

* Is it usable?
* Is it desirable?
* Have you made it findable—that is, will a user know where to find what they're looking for?
* Is it accessible?
* Is it credible?
* Is it valuable?

#### ## Where do UX and UI overlap?

Scan online job listings, and you'll notice employers seeking UX/UI\
designers— digital designers who can fulfill both roles.

This may be a stretch, but it's possible,.

"You can work in a team where you have UI designers and UX designers as separate\
disciplines, But a product designer or UX designer might take on UI responsibilities, working alongside someone like a business analyst to understand all of the scenarios that need to be covered."

While UI is generally understood as a specialized subset of UX work, there are three key areas of overlap:

1. **User-centered design expertise.** Both disciplines require designers to develop empathy for the end user and consider how users want to use a product or site.
2. **Cross-functional teams.** Designers\
   working on UI and UX must collaborate closely with graphic designers\
   and developers to make products and sites appealing, accessible,\
   and usable.
3. **Design tools.** UX and UI designers use many of the same kind of tools.

## Video Lesson Speech

\[ENG]

**Jordan Hudgens:** Standing right next to me is Jesse Cook. Jesse is the CEO and the Creative Director for the Slate dev shop in Lehi, Utah. I've had the privilege of\
working with Jesse for over a year now and I've absolutely loved the\
experience.

He has been able to completely upgrade the way that devCamp\
looks, so if you've noticed a difference, then you have Jesse to thank\
for that. He is very good at what he does.

For this course, I wanted to bring someone in who is truly a\
specialist. I decide not to teach the user experience course on my own\
because it's not my specialty. I've only received very light and\
informal training in UX and UI, which I think is the case for many\
developers.

That's the purpose behind this course. We want to teach you what\
happens and what's needed in order to properly design an application.

Now, I think one of the biggest problems with the perception of\
design in the development world is that people may think designers are\
just the people who pick out what colors and fonts go on the screen, but\
there is **so** much more to it than that. There is an entire science behind how user experience is built.

I want to introduce Jesse for that side of the process, and in this\
guide, we're going to take a high-level look at what "creative\
direction" is. Jesse, talk a little bit about some of the things, from a\
creative direction perspective, that you do when you're working with\
clients or when you're working on an application.

**Jesse Cook:** _We specifically work a lot with_\
&#xNAN;_&#x63;lients, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you're always going to_\
&#xNAN;_&#x62;e in that position. You might be working for some tech company that has_\
&#xNAN;_&#x6F;ne app and you have a manager that you're reporting to, but they are_\
&#xNAN;_&#x76;ery similar scenarios._

_The idea is that the creative director is approached because_\
_something needs to be built or changed. What they do is take the vision_\
_of whoever's approached them, and get that vision on paper. It seems a_\
_lot more straightforward than it usually ends up being._

_The analogy that I always give my clients is to draw a bicycle._\
&#xNAN;_&#x54;he idea is that everyone knows what a bicycle looks like; they know_\
&#xNAN;_&#x77;hat an app looks like in their mind. But when you actually sit people_\
&#xNAN;_&#x64;own, statistically, 75 percent of people will draw a bicycle_\
&#xNAN;_&#x69;ncorrectly, even though we all know what it looks like._

_That's what I tell my clients. They know what it looks like but_\
&#xNAN;_&#x74;hey don't necessarily know how the data is going around. They might not_\
&#xNAN;_&#x65;ven know all the users that need to exist to create that data. They_\
&#xNAN;_&#x74;hink, "Oh! Then this needs to be approved!" Well, who's approving that_\
&#xNAN;_&#x70;rocedure? Who is interacting with this data? They need to be able to_\
&#xNAN;_&#x73;ee the multi-dimensional structure that these apps create. And_ that's _what_\
&#xNAN;_&#x74;he creative director does. They help bring this idea to a point where_\
&#xNAN;_&#x79;ou can really follow the entire objective all the way through to all_\
&#xNAN;_&#x74;he different users._

**JH:** That's awesome, and it's something that I've\
found so critical through the years because the user experience is not\
my specialty. When I'm on a project by myself, or I'm the person in\
charge of the UX, it doesn't look as good as when I'm able to go and\
implement _your_ designs. It slows down my progress because I'm\
spending so much time simply figuring out where all the components on\
the page need to be, and who's allowed to interact with them, and what\
happens if they click on this button versus this other one. Whereas, my\
development time speeds up astronomically when Jesse sends me a set of\
screens and a full set of wireframes on what I need to go build.

That is a huge part of why we wanted to build this course, because if\
you can learn how to develop your own UI and UX -- have you heard of\
the "Unicorn" term?

**JC:** _Yeah, yeah._

**JH:** If you've never heard of it, there is a term for\
if you are very good at design and also very good at development. The\
reason is that such a person is about as rare as a unicorn. We want to\
turn everyone who goes through this course into a unicorn.

We have a number of great modules throughout this system and we also\
took a little bit of a different approach, here. I have seen a number of\
other courses that combined both UI and UX into the same course. I\
purposefully wanted to create one UX course and one UI course because\
they're completely different disciplines. It's usually the same person\
who's asked you to do them, just like you, Jesse.

**JC:** \*Haha! \*

**JH:** But if you start to think, "Oh, if I'm doing\
UI/UX, that means that I'm just working a lot in Photoshop and making\
things look pretty," I think that completely devalues the entire UX\
portion.

**JC:** \*Right. \*

**JH:** While we were going through the outline for this\
course, we started to realize how much time was spent in building out\
the right user experience, as opposed to just making things look pretty.\
I wanted to make sure that we really focused on that so that you would\
value it as much as it really deserves. I can promise that when you\
actually get out and start building real-world applications, having this\
skill set can set you apart from all the other developers that are out\
there.

**JC:** _Oh, absolutely! My developers are incredibly_\
&#xNAN;_&#x76;aluable because, occasionally, I get some things wrong, and sometimes_\
&#xNAN;_&#x69;t will get to the point where I'm explaining something to either the_\
&#xNAN;_&#x43;TO, or the CTO is explaining it to the developers, and, if they've_\
&#xNAN;_&#x72;eally developed that critical thinking, they might say "Where is this_\
&#xNAN;_&#x63;oming from? Where am I supposed to pull this data from?" And maybe the_\
&#xNAN;_&#x61;pplication needs a higher level admin or a different user, or maybe it_\
&#xNAN;_&#x6E;eeds to happen on a different page. It's_ _**so**_ _helpful_\
&#xNAN;_&#x66;or those things to be found sooner, and not after two weeks of_\
&#xNAN;_&#x64;evelopment. At that point, they may realize they have to go back and_\
&#xNAN;_&#x72;efactor a bunch of stuff._

_I love it when my developers can, right off the bat, identify_\
&#xNAN;_&#x73;omething that I've missed. It's definitely a unicorn moment. A lot of_\
&#xNAN;_&#x74;imes, something just falls through the cracks. And then eventually it's_\
&#xNAN;_&#x6C;ike - oh my gosh - how did I miss that? It's definitely something_\
&#xNAN;_&#x77;here, if you can really hone those skills to be able to see the_\
&#xNAN;_&#x6D;ulti-dimensional aspect of these applications really quickly and bounce_\
&#xNAN;_&#x62;ack and forth between the granular and the big picture--You want to be_\
&#xNAN;_&#x61;ble to zoom in and see that, but you don't want to be so close to it_\
&#xNAN;_&#x74;hat you can't see and understand the bigger picture._

**JH:** Absolutely. That's a great introduction to\
everything that we're going to be going through in this course. We're\
going to be talking about the different concepts you'll need to learn in\
order to build a solid user experience, and we're going to be using a\
number of case studies that we have worked on so that we can tell you\
some of the things we did that were good and also a few the things we\
might have done differently.
