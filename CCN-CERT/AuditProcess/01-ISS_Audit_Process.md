# General Auditing concepts

## Auditing Team components.

Certification Entities must have qualified and sufficient staff to perform Certification Audits under/against the security schema on which are based.  
Specifically, they must have at least:

1. **Chief Auditors**  
    At least as many Chief Auditors as the number of simultaneous audits the Certification Entity (EC) or Technical Audit Body (OAT) can conduct.  
  
2. **Auditors**  
    Enough number of auditors to perform the audits contracted.  
  
3. **Technical Experts**  
    If needed, to support the audit team.  
  

### Chief Auditor:

The Chief Auditor must demonstrate:

- **Training** in information systems audits, through nationally and internationally recognized certifications, or through courses, seminars, or regulated training activities by recognized quality entities that allow the demonstration of sufficient knowledge.

- Verifiable **experience** of at least 4 years in regularly conducting information technology audits.
  
- Proved **knowledge** on security risk management, with at least 4 years of experience in these areas. Applied on (spanish) RD 3/2010 requirements, demonstrated through courses or seminars with sufficient quality and scope, comprising a minimum of 20 hours of training.
  
- **Plenty knowledge of applicable legislation** when the audit might require evaluating compliance with measures derived from other regulations, such as data protection or the National Interoperability Scheme, among others.
  

### Auditors:

**Must have sufficient training in both security and information systems** auditing, depending on the responsibilities assigned during the evaluation process.

- The audit team members must be familiar with the applicable CCN-STIC Security Guides (or the applicable guides from which regulations and laws are applied under their jurisdiction) and have knowledge and experience in managing operating systems security, applications, computer network infrastructures, and cryptographic mechanisms.  
  
- Must not have participated or held responsibilities in the audited information system in the last two years, nor have been acted as consultants during its implementation of RD 3/2010 requirements.  

- All members of the audit team, especially external auditors and technical experts, **must have signed a confidentiality agreement before beginning** the audit.  
 
### Technical Experts:

Specialized in specific areas which enhance the audit team's knowledge when the team lacks the necessary technical expertise on a particular matter or technology (e.g., Blockchain).

Their involvement, always subject to the Chief Auditor's decisions, allows a deeper evaluation of the audited client.

#### General Roles on a Certification Entity

Certification Entities must have qualified and sufficient staff members to perform Certification Audits under the aplicable Security Schema.  
Specifically, they must have at least:

1. **Audit File Reviewers**: 
  The qualifications, training, and experience of the staff responsible for reviewing audit files must be at least equivalent to the requirements for the Chief Auditor to ensure an effective evaluation process.
  
  This is in accordance with section 7.5 of ISO/IEC 17065:2012 (used for the accreditation process of ENS Certification Entities).
  
2. **Technical Responsible**: 
  The technical manager may act as the Chief Audit Team Leader.  
  Their routines include:  
  
  - Ensuring that the entity follows CCN and ENAC (or the aplicables) guidelines in certification processes, including evaluations.
  - Verifying that all entity processes comply with ISO 17065.
  - Supervising the technical capacity and performance of the audit team and ensuring their continuous training regarding the ENS and auditing methods.
  - Presiding over the Certification Committee, which is responsible for certifying or not certifying the client based on the Chief Auditor's report.
  - Assigning the most suitable audit team for each client, ensuring impartiality in relation to the audited client.

## Essential Laws of the Audit Process

### Integrity

The Audit Team must carry out their **work ethically, with honesty and responsibility**; they must only perform auditing activities if they are competent to do so; **develop their work impartially** and remain **aware of any influence** that may affect their judgment during the audit.

### Results reports

The Audit Team is obligated to report audit results, **including conclusions, truthfully and accurately, ensuring that Audit Reports reflect the activities carried out**.  
They must also **report significant obstacles encountered** during the audit and **unresolved divergent opinions between the Audit Team and the audited entity**.   
**Communication must be truthful, precise, objective, timely, clear, and complete.**

### Proffesional Diligenge

The Audit Team must behave due **professional diligence according to the importance of the task and the trust placed** in them by the audit client and other interested parties.  
It is crucial to **make reasoned judgments in all audit situations**.

### Confidenciality

The Audit Team must perform their **work discreetly and protect the information obtained**.  
**Audit information should not be misused for personal benefit, nor should it harm the legitimate interests of the audited party. This includes proper management of sensitive or confidential information.**

### Independence

Audit Team staff **must be independent of the activity being audited** whenever possible and, in all cases, act **free from biases and conflicts of interest**.  
For internal audits, auditors must be independent of the audited function if possible. Auditors must maintain objectivity throughout the audit to ensure that audit findings and conclusions are based solely on the evidence collected.  
In small organizations, total independence may not be possible, but **every effort should be made to eliminate bias and promote objectivity**.  
However, **each regulation the audit is based on may contain its own rules regarding independence and impartiality.**  

### Evidence-based approaching

- **Audit evidence must be verifiable.**  
Evidence is the rational method to reach reliable and reproducible audit conclusions.  

In general, audits should be based on samples of available information since the audit is conducted over a finite period with limited resources.  
When necessary, appropriate use of sampling must be applied as it is closely related to the confidence that can be placed in the audit conclusions.

### Risk-based approaching

Audits **should consider risks and opportunities**.   
The risk-based approach should significantly influence the planning, execution, and presentation of Audit Reports to ensure that the audits focus on matters important to the audit client and achieve the objectives of the audit program.

## Audit Program configuration

To understand the context of the audited entity, the audit program must consider the following:

- The organization’s objectives.
  
- Relevant internal and external issues.
  
- The needs and expectations of relevant stakeholders.
  
- The information security handled, especially regarding its confidentiality.
  

## Audit Program Extension

It must be based on the size and nature of the entity, the complexity, functionality, type of risks and opportunities, and the maturity level of the system being audited.

## Functionality of the System to be Audited

This can be more complex when many important functions are subcontracted and managed under the leadership of other organizations. Special attention should be given to where the most critical decisions are made and what constitutes the system's top management.

## Implementing an Audit Program

Once the audit program is established and related resources are determined, operational planning and coordination of all activities within the program are required.

The person managing the audit program must:

1. Communicate relevant parts of the audit program to stakeholders and provide regular updates on its progress.
  
2. Define objectives, scope, and audit criteria.
  
3. Select audit methods.
  
4. Ensure that documented information is managed and maintained properly.
  
5. Coordinate and schedule the audit and other relevant activities.
  
6. Ensure that documented information is managed and maintained properly.
  
7. Provide the necessary individual and general resources to the Audit Team.
  
8. Define and implement necessary operational controls to monitor the audit program and identify improvement opportunities.
  
9. Ensure the audit is performed according to the audit program.

  b) Evaluating the system's ability to help the organization meet applicable legal and other requirements. 
  c) Evaluating the system's effectiveness in achieving expected results. 
  d) Identifying opportunities for system improvement. 
  e) Evaluating the system's suitability and adequacy regarding the context and strategic direction of the audited entity. 
  f) Evaluating the system's ability to set and achieve objectives and address risks and opportunities effectively in a changing context, including implementing related actions.
  
2. **Scope**  
     The audit scope represents the extent and limits of the audit and must be consistent with the Audit Program and objectives. It includes factors such as locations, functions, activities, processes to be audited, and the period covered.
  
  The audit objectives define what should be achieved, including:  
  a) Determining the degree of system compliance with audit criteria.  
  b) Evaluating the system's ability to help the organization meet applicable legal and other requirements.  
  c) Evaluating the system's effectiveness in achieving expected results.  
  d) Identifying opportunities for system improvement.  
  e) Evaluating the system's suitability and adequacy regarding the context and strategic direction of the audited entity.  
  f) Evaluating the system's ability to set and achieve objectives and address risks and opportunities effectively in a changing context, including implementing related actions.
  
3. **Audit Criteria** 
  Audit criteria are used as a reference to determine conformity.  
  These can include:  
    Applicable policies, processes, procedures, performance criteria (including objectives), legal and regulatory requirements, system requirements, information about the context and risks, and opportunities as determined by the audited entity (including relevant external information), internal stakeholder requirements, industry codes of conduct, or other planned agreements.  

  If there were changes in objectives, scope, or criteria, the audit program should be modified as necessary and communicated to stakeholders for approval, when applicable.
