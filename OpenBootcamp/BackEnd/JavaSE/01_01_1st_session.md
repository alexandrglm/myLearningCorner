## ðŸ”¸ Definitions

### âš¡ What's Java?  
Java is a robust and versatile object-oriented programming language (OOP) introduced in 1995 by Sun Microsystems (now, since 2009, Sun Microsystems was adquired by its new owner, Oracle), aimed to be run on almost-any kind of device.  
  
Therefore, many other languages like C#, dotNET, started to be created to face the Java dominance as its competitors.  

### âš¡ Java features:
	* Java Syntax
	With very basic syntax easily become familiar and just 50 reserved words.  
	  
	* Java is FOSS
	Even being againts the benefits of (and also not directly by) Oracle, OpenJDK is  available, a Java Development environment free and open-source.  
	
	* Java is Compiled and Interpreted, so that getting the best flexibility
	A mix of advantages taken from compiled languages (faster coding but limited to an specific platform) plus interpreted languages (slower coding development, debugging process only available at runtime execution, but universal as enable to be executed on any platform). The Java code is first compiled into the Bytecode (language interpretator) between and thus the JVM (Java VirtualMachine).  	

###  âš¡ Java development uses:
	* Websites 
	* GUI's (EclipseIDE, a tool for developing in Java created in Java, Spotify client, ...)
	* Frameworks (Lightweight, LibGDX)
	* Applications (Android Studio pre-Kotlin era, )

***
### âš¡	More keynotes about Java  

- Java releases: Each 6 months, excepting Java LTS
- Java 8 brought high changes.

- SDK version used in the course: SDK 17.
- SDK vresion used for me: SDK 23.
Since OpenJDK v-24 is still in testing-notProduction mode and SDK 23 offers high backward compatibility and there's no functions deprecated nor high syntax structures changes, so the newer SDK the better in this case.

- IDE used: IntelliJ
- Servers used: Apache
- Frameworks used:
- 

High-level language. Multiparadigma. Permite programas flexibles.

## Configuring and using IntelliJ

## Creating new session
1. Creating new package  
Package itinerary tends to be named the same as the developer/creator/enterprise website has, but upside down.  
E.g.:  
> My website:	example.com -- so, the itinerary will be --> com.example
  
2. Creating a class  
- .class files always using CamelCase, but the first letter UPPERCASE.  
- .class content:
```java
package com.example;

public class HelloWorld {

}
```
Explained:  
```text
package + itinerary;

// here, packages-modules-classes importing will be called.

public keyword + class keyword + className + keys open symbol {

	// This is the place for all the code

	// line by line

close key symbol }
```


- The code has to be initialised, always, using enabling the `main`method, by several ways.  

1. By using shortcuts.  
By typing main, this IDE will set the main method automatically.  

2.  By typing the initialise code by hand, like this:  

```java
public static void main(String[] args){

}
```

- Now, we can add a first code line to test all relations correctibility or not, for example, by typing a simple printing on screen a string.  
```java

System.out.println("Hello world, testing init relations");

```

The initialise code will be like this:  
```java
package com.example;

public class HelloWorld {

    public static void main(String[] args){

        System.out.println("Hello World");

    }
    
}
```
.println method is the most basic method to start testing the class environment. More (complex) methods will be detailed.  

- Now, it's time to get compiled and tested our code, by clicking on "RUN" icon or *right-click* > Run.  
![image1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0075bced-8348-405a-af4d-d86705ade2c0)
The code, at this point, is being bytecode-compiled, ready to be interpreted by the JVM.    
We notice that IntelliJ IDE shows on the botton side the JVM console the compilining and execution flags.  
*...with exit code 0* means there were no erros at any time.  
  
- Finally, proved that this initialise configuration is made in the proper way (it works), coding process can be started.
***

# SYNTAX (1)  
  
## CamelCase, but how?  
  
'Classes, files`:  CamelCase **LikeThis**. First letter always Uppercase.

`Variables, Methods/Functions, etc`: cameCase **likeThis**. First letter from the first word to lowercase.
***
## Shorcuts:  

While the behaviour when coding should be to not shorcutting any ways, IntelliJ IDE offers a wide range of methods' shorcuts to empower the coding process.  

`main`		Initialises the project static void main method

`sout`		System.out.println	
`soutm`		Prints the current class name and method
`soutp`		Prints the method parameters and values
`soutv`		Prints a value
***
## Indentation  

Even not giving a indentation to our code, and dislike as when coding another languages as Python, the standards for indentation coding JAVA seems to be *ONE TAB equal to FOUR SPACES*.  
Also, giving one blank line each line is the commons.  
***
## Comments & Documentating code process  

Taking notes is so useful in any creating process, also including here, when developing. As many other languages, Java has its own routine of comments.  
```java
// This is the simpliest way to give a comment in one line

 		/*
        This is a multi-line comment, useful for planning step by step. E.g.:
        1- Step1. Create the function sum
        2. Create number variable
        3. Use sum function to get the sum of both numbers
         */
```
  
Also, a documentation process using JAVADoc may contain a deep technique information about the method is attached to.   
JAVADocs always goes at the same indentation level as the object is referencing. E.g.:  
```Java
    /**
     * Title: Entrypoint to java application
     * Description: Lets the application xecution.
     *
     * @param args - Entry arguments for the application
     *
     *
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
```


```Java
package com.example;


/**
 * Test class to create a simply Java application
 */
public class ByeWorld {


    /**
     * This is a JAVADoc. Entrypoint to java application
     * Lets the application xecution.
     **
     * @param args - Entry arguments for the application
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    
        // This is a simple-line comment
        System.out.println("ByeWorld.main");

        /*
        This is a multi-line comment, useful for planning step by step:
        1- Step1. Create the function sum
        2. Create number variable
        3. Use sum function to get the sum of both numbers
         */


    }

}
```
***
## Data types  

1.	Number  
1.1	Integer  
1.2 Decimal  

2. Boolean  

3. String  

```Java
      // 1.   Numbers
        
        // 1.1  Integers
        byte variableOne = 1;
        short variableTwo = 100;
        int variableThree = 100000;
        long variableFour = 10000000000;

        long phoneNumber = 666145474;
        
        // long price = null; // It deserves a further explanation.

        // 1.2  Decimals
        float variableFive = 5.5f;
        double variableSix = 10.5d;
        variableSix = 20.5d; // here, the variable has been value-changed.
        double productPrice = 49.99d;

        // 2.   Booleans
        boolean variable7 = true;
        boolean variable8 = false;

        // 3.   Strings
        char variableNine = 'a';
        String variableTen = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit anet ...";
        /**
		* String is used 'String' because is a method. Further explanations will come
		*/
```
***
## Creating variables  

Due to the nature of strongness typing Java is, the variable data type needs to be declared. It's told at the start of the line.  

A common schema of creating a number variable is:  

> #### *Data Type + Variable Name + AssignOperator (=) + The value*;    

Numbers and also Strings data types are used by an incremental value size:  
| Data Type | Sizw   | Range/Precission |
|--------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `byte`       | 8 bits   | Range: -128 ~ +127                                                         |
| `short`      | 16 bits  | Range: -32,768 ~ +32,767                                                   |
| `int`        | 32 bits  | Range: -2,147,483,648 ~ +2,147,483,647                                     |
| `long`       | 64 bits  | Range: -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 ~ +9,223,372,036,854,775,807             |
| `float`      | 32 bits  | Precission: 6-7 decimals, a double-word of 16bit.                                                  |
| `double`     | 64 bits  | Precission: 15 decimals, a double-word of 32bit.                                                   |
| `char`       | 16 bits  | Range: 0 a 65,535 (a unique UniCode character possible)                  |
| `string`     | Variable | Depends of the string size. Every character uses 1 word (2 bytes, UTF-16).      |
