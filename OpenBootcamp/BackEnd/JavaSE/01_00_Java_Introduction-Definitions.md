### âš¡ What's Java?  
Java is a robust and versatile object-oriented programming language (OOP) introduced in 1995 by Sun Microsystems (now, since 2009, Sun Microsystems was adquired by its new owner, Oracle), aimed to be run on almost-any kind of device.  
  
Therefore, many other languages like C#, dotNET, have been beign created to face the Java dominance as its competitors.  



### âš¡ Java features:
	* Java Syntax
	With very basic syntax easily become familiar and just 50 reserved words.  
	  
	* Java is FOSS
	Even being againts the benefits of (and also not directly by) Oracle, OpenJDK is  available, a Java Development environment free and open-source.  
	
	* Java is Compiled and Interpreted, so that getting the best flexibility
	A mix of advantages taken from compiled languages (faster coding but limited to an specific platform) plus interpreted languages (slower coding development, debugging process only available at runtime execution, but universal as enable to be executed on any platform). The Java code is first compiled into the Bytecode (language interpretator) between and thus the JVM (Java VirtualMachine).  
	

###  âš¡ Java development uses:
	* Websites 
	* GUI's (EclipseIDE, a tool for developing in Java created in Java, Spotify client, ...)
	* Frameworks (Lightweight, LibGDX)
	* Applications (Android Studio pre-Kotlin era, )
