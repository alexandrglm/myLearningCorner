## Video Lesson Speech

We're going to start off this section on the class diagrams with a 
review. You may be curious on why we're returning to this topic class 
diagram. We've walked through it a few times.

A Class diagram has three elements.

- Name
- Attributes
- Operations

The name is the most self-explanatory piece, we have a topic which is
 the name for this class diagram. In a real-world scenario, you wouldn't
 add these specific types of notes like class name because it's 
self-explanatory.

Attributes have three different items at a minimum that you should include.

- Visibility (public/protected/private can be denoted with a plus/hash/minus)
- Name
- Data Type

Operations are methods/functions. Add a plus if you want to call from
 outside of the topic or a minus if you do not want to call outside the 
topic. Also, operations are always followed by parentheses.
