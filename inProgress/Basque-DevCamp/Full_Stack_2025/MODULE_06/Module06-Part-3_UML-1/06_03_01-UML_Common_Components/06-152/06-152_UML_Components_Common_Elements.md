## Video Lesson Speech

As you start to go through this course, you’re going to notice a number 
of common elements that are used. In the next video, I’m going to walk

called and how they can be used.

Now these are not the diagrams themselves, these are just some common elements that you’ll see are shared across various diagrams. 

The six common elements are we’re going to walk through are:

* Frames

* Classifiers 

* Stereotypes 

* Comments 

* Dependencies

* Features (which are also called Properties)
