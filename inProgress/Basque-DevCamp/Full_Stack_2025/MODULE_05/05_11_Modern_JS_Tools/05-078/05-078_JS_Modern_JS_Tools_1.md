## Video Lesson Speech



This is going to be a fun section of the course. In this section, we're 
going to talk about JavaScript tools and this is going to be a little 
bit different than some other sections in the course.

This will also be different than a typical section in a course that builds an entire project. And the reason is because I'm going to leave this section completely open. I'm going to keep on coming back and adding new guides as I personally find other tools that I find beneficial in my own workflow. 

I'm going to organize the tools that we go through into three main categories. The first is going to be a set of universal tools. So these are tools that you can use in pretty much every version of JavaScript they'll work in every major browser and you can use them however you see fit. 

The second category of tools is going to be something that is specific to modern versions of javascript. There are a number of very cool code libraries out there like [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) that we're going to go through that you're going to see in many different applications. However, they will typically only work with the most modern versions of JavaScript. 

The third category of tool is going to be a set of tools that are specific to a code editor. So this is going to be a little bit different because I personally use [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?wt.mc_id=adw-brandcore-editor&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI6v3epfvk2AIVhVp-Ch3SZwnLEAAYASAAEgJOrvD_BwE) for all of my front end development and so most of the guides from there are going to be using the VS code editor and part of the reason for that and why I wanted to include it in this course is because we're going to start getting into some more advanced topics and we're going to move away from using code pen and I'm going to start working locally and showing you how to work local and when you do that you're going to see some very different types of behavior when I work inside of vs code. 

I have a number of extensions that I utilize that make my own workflow as efficient as possible and so I didn't want to go straight into those other sections without giving you some detailed explanations on what those extensions do they are not a requirement for you to use on your own system. I'm simply going to give you a set of options so you can see a range of what you can personally use and then you can just pick and choose exactly what works best for your own workflow.
