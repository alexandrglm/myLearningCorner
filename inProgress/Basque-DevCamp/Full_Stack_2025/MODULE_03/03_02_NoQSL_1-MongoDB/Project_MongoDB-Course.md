# MongoDB Course.

## Preamble

***

### **1. What is MongoDB?**

MongoDB is a **NoSQL database** designed for modern application development.   

Unlike traditional relational databases (SQL), MongoDB stores data in **flexible, JSON-like documents** (BSON format).   

This allows developers to work with data in a way that aligns more naturally with how applications are built today.

****

#### Key Features:

- **Document-oriented**:     
  
  Data is stored as documents, which are hierarchical and can contain nested structures.

- **Schemaless**:    
  
  Collections (similar to tables in SQL) do not enforce a fixed schema, allowing for dynamic and evolving data models.

- **Scalable**:  
   MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally, meaning you can distribute 
  data across multiple servers (sharding) to handle large datasets and 
  high traffic.

- **High performance**:   
  
  Optimized for read/write operations, with support for indexing, caching, and in-memory processing.

****

### **2. Core Concepts in MongoDB**

To understand MongoDB, you need to familiarize yourself with its core components:

#### **Collections**

- Collections are groups of documents, similar to tables in SQL.

- Unlike SQL tables, collections do not enforce a strict schema. Documents within a collection can have different structures.

#### **Documents**

- Documents are the basic unit of data in MongoDB, stored in BSON (Binary JSON) format.

- Each document is a set of key-value pairs, where values can be strings, numbers, arrays, nested objects, or even binary data.
  
  Example:
  
  ```json
  {
    "_id": ObjectId("64b8f1c7e4b0a1a2b3c4d5e6"),
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 28,
    "address": {
      "city": "New York",
      "zip": "10001"
    },
    "hobbies": ["reading", "traveling", "photography"]
  }
  ```

#### **Fields**

- Fields are the key-value pairs within a document.   
  For example, `name`, `age`, and `address` are fields in the document above.

#### **Indexes**

- Indexes improve query performance by allowing MongoDB to quickly locate documents.

- You can create indexes on specific fields (e.g., `name`, `age`) or even nested fields (e.g., `address.city`).

### **3. When to Use MongoDB**

MongoDB is particularly well-suited for the following scenarios:

#### **Use Cases**

- **Content Management Systems (CMS)**:  
  
  Flexible schema allows for storing diverse content types (e.g., blogs, articles, media).

- **Real-time Analytics**:  
  MongoDB’s aggregation framework and indexing make it ideal for analyzing large datasets in real time.

- **Internet of Things (IoT)**:  
  MongoDB can handle high volumes of data from IoT devices, with support for time-series data.

- **E-commerce Platforms**:  
  MongoDB’s ability to store product catalogs, user profiles, and orders in a flexible schema is a great fit for e-commerce.

- **Mobile and Web Applications**:  
  MongoDB’s JSON-like documents align well with the data structures used in modern apps.

#### **When Not to Use MongoDB**

- **Highly Transactional Systems**:  
   If your application requires complex transactions with ACID guarantees 
  (e.g., banking systems), a relational database might be a better choice.

- **Strict Schema Requirements**:  
  If your data model is highly structured and unlikely to change, a relational database could be more efficient.

****

### **4. Data Modeling in MongoDB**

One of the most important aspects of working with MongoDB is designing your data model.   
Unlike SQL, where you normalize data into tables, MongoDB encourages **denormalization** and **embedding** for performance and simplicity.

#### **Embedding vs. Referencing**

- **Embedding**: Store related data within a single document.  
  This is ideal for one-to-one or one-to-few relationships.
  
  ```json
  {
    "_id": ObjectId("64b8f1c7e4b0a1a2b3c4d5e6"),
    "name": "Alice",
    "orders": [
      { "order_id": 1, "product": "Laptop", "price": 1200 },
      { "order_id": 2, "product": "Phone", "price": 800 }
    ]
  }
  ```

- **Referencing**: Store references (IDs) to related documents in another collection. This is better for one-to-many or 
  many-to-many relationships.
  
  ```json
  {
    "_id": ObjectId("64b8f1c7e4b0a1a2b3c4d5e6"),
    "name": "Alice",
    "order_ids": [ObjectId("64b8f1c7e4b0a1a2b3c4d5e7"), ObjectId("64b8f1c7e4b0a1a2b3c4d5e8")]
  }
  ```

#### **Best Practices for Data Modeling**

- **Favor Embedding for Read-Heavy Workloads**: Embedding reduces the need for joins, making reads faster.

- **Use Referencing for Large or Frequently Updated Data**: Referencing avoids duplicating data and makes updates more efficient.

- **Consider Document Size**: MongoDB has a 16MB document size limit. Avoid embedding large arrays or deeply nested structures.

- **Plan for Indexes**: Identify fields that will be frequently queried and create indexes for them.

****

### **5. Querying and Aggregation**

MongoDB provides powerful tools for querying and analyzing data.

#### **Basic Queries**

- Find documents that match specific criteria:
  
  ```js
  db.users.find({ age: { $gt: 25 } });
  ```

- Use projection to return only specific fields:
  
  ```js
  db.users.find({}, { name: 1, age: 1 });
  ```

#### **Aggregation Framework**

The aggregation framework allows you to perform complex data transformations and 
analysis. It works like a pipeline, where each stage processes the data and passes it to the next stage.

- Example: Group users by city and calculate the average age:
  
  ```js
  db.users.aggregate([
    { $group: { _id: "$address.city", avgAge: { $avg: "$age" } } }
  ]);
  ```

****

### **6. Example Project: Blog Platform**

Let’s design a simple blogging platform using MongoDB.

#### **Collections**

1. **Users**:
   
   ```json
   {
     "_id": ObjectId("64b8f1c7e4b0a1a2b3c4d5e6"),
     "name": "Alice",
     "email": "alice@example.com",
     "password": "hashed_password"
   }
   ```

2. **Posts**:
   
   ```json
   {
     "_id": ObjectId("64b8f1c7e4b0a1a2b3c4d5e7"),
     "title": "Introduction to MongoDB",
     "content": "MongoDB is a NoSQL database...",
     "author_id": ObjectId("64b8f1c7e4b0a1a2b3c4d5e6"),
     "tags": ["MongoDB", "NoSQL", "Database"],
     "created_at": ISODate("2023-10-01T12:00:00Z")
   }
   ```

3. **Comments**:
   
   ```json
   {
     "_id": ObjectId("64b8f1c7e4b0a1a2b3c4d5e8"),
     "post_id": ObjectId("64b8f1c7e4b0a1a2b3c4d5e7"),
     "user_id": ObjectId("64b8f1c7e4b0a1a2b3c4d5e6"),
     "comment": "Great post!",
     "created_at": ISODate("2023-10-01T12:30:00Z")
   }
   ```

#### **Queries**

- Find all posts by a specific user:
  
  ```js
  db.posts.find({ author_id: ObjectId("64b8f1c7e4b0a1a2b3c4d5e6") });
  ```

- Find all comments for a specific post:
  
  ```js
  db.comments.find({ post_id: ObjectId("64b8f1c7e4b0a1a2b3c4d5e7") });
  ```

****

### Some Best Practices

- **Start Small**: Begin with a simple data model and evolve it as your application grows.

- **Monitor Performance**: Use MongoDB’s built-in tools to monitor query performance and optimize indexes.

- **Backup Your Data**: Regularly back up your database to prevent data loss.

- **Learn the Aggregation Framework**: It’s one of MongoDB’s most powerful features for data analysis.

# MODULE 03-161: MongoDB (0)

* **Part 1: Guide to NoSQL for Developers**

* **Part 2: Complete NoSQL vs SQL guide**

****

## Part 1: Guide to NoSQL for Developers

This guide will walk through a straightforward explanation of how NoSQL databases work and when they should be used in an application.

### What are NoSQL Databases?

So first and foremost: what are NoSQL databases, and why should I care about them? The easiest way to understand the definition is that **NoSQL databases are not SQL databases**.

- **Standard relational SQL databases** such as Oracle’s SQL server or MySQL have a **tabular structure**, similar to what you’d see in an Excel spreadsheet.
- **NoSQL databases**, on the other hand, have **various types of formats** and can, therefore, be more flexible.

---

### When to Use NoSQL?

For example, imagine that you had to build an application where users were able to define their own fields, such as a survey application where one user may create a survey with two fields and another may create a survey with a hundred fields, and they need to have the ability to be named on the fly.

- **Relational databases** could technically implement this, but it would be very clunky.
- **NoSQL databases** could handle this easily by allowing the fields to be created dynamically, and then each record would be stored with its unique characteristics.

---

### Flexibility vs. Challenges

It’s important to note that one of the greatest strengths of NoSQL—its flexibility—also presents its greatest challenge.

Imagine that you are building out an inventory application that has fields that need to connect to other tables, such as a user table for the employee entering the information, a vendor table, and a tax table to calculate depreciation.

- If you were to attempt to implement a **NoSQL database** for this inventory option, you’d end up having to work very hard to map the values between the models, and it would also make for a very difficult application to maintain.
- In this case study, a **relational database (RDBMS)** would work perfectly.

---

### Choosing the Right Database

So when you’re trying to decide on which database to use, it really comes down to what the requirements of the application are.

- If you wanted to chop a tree down, you wouldn’t use a hammer; you’d use an ax because it’s basic common sense to utilize the right tool for the right job.
- It’s the same way with software development. I don’t believe in the SQL vs. NoSQL debate; they are both tools, and they are the most effective when used in an application that works well with their strengths.

---

### Guidelines for Choosing Between SQL and NoSQL

A good rule of thumb is to simply follow the guidelines given by the names themselves:

- **If you have data that relies heavily on relationships**, then it’s probably the best fit to utilize a **relational SQL database**.
- **If you have an unstructured data set that needs flexibility**, then it may be the best option to go with a database that is **Not SQL**, such as a **NoSQL database**.

---

### Example of NoSQL in MongoDB

For an example of how NoSQL looks, here is a snippet from a MongoDB database:

```json
{
 "_id": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
 "name": "John Doe",
 "age": 30,
 "address": {
 "street": "123 Main St",
 "city": "Anytown",
 "state": "CA",
 "zip": "12345"
 },
 "hobbies": ["reading", "hiking", "coding"]
}
```

Notice how it really just looks like JSON code? It actually is using a form of JSON called **BSON**, short for **Binary JSON**, and it really is just a set of key-value pair data stores that can be structured however your application needs.

****

### Comparison with Relational SQL

This is in comparison with a **relational SQL table**.
 Notice how NoSQL databases encapsulate all of the data into a single object, whereas the SQL structure is built around relationships.

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT
);

CREATE TABLE addresses (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    street VARCHAR(100),
    city VARCHAR(100),
    state VARCHAR(2),
    zip VARCHAR(10),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

****

### Types of NoSQL Databases

If you’re interested in building 
applications with NoSQL databases, it’s important to understand that 
there is no such thing as a standard NoSQL database; there are many 
different variations.

- **Key/Value pair stores**

- **Wide-column family stores**

- **Document databases**

- **Graph databases**

I’ll place a link in the show notes where you can explore each type and see what will work best for your application.

## Part 2: Complete NoSQL vs SQL guide

### What is SQL?

SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a programming language used to communicate with and manage relational databases. SQL databases are table-based, meaning they store data in rows and columns.   

Each row represents a unique record, and each column represents a field within that record. SQL databases are known for their ability to handle complex queries and transactions, making them ideal for applications that require strong consistency and integrity, such as financial systems.

### What is NoSQL?

NoSQL, or "Not Only SQL," is a type of database that provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in 
relational databases.   

NoSQL databases are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, making them ideal for big data and real-time web applications.   

They are highly scalable and can handle large amounts of data and traffic with ease.

### Key Differences Between SQL and NoSQL

1. **Data Structure**:
   
   - **SQL**: Table-based, with rows and columns.
   
   - **NoSQL**: Document-based, key-value pairs, wide-column stores, or graph databases.

2. **Scalability**:
   
   - **SQL**: Vertically scalable (adding more power to the server).
   
   - **NoSQL**: Horizontally scalable (adding more servers).

3. **Schema**:
   
   - **SQL**: Fixed schema, meaning the structure of the data must be defined in advance.
   
   - **NoSQL**: Dynamic schema, allowing for more flexibility in data structure.

4. **Transactions**:
   
   - **SQL**: ACID-compliant (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
   
   - **NoSQL**: Often BASE-compliant (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency).

5. **Use Cases**:
   
   - **SQL**: Best for complex queries, transactions, and applications requiring strong consistency.
   
   - **NoSQL**: Best for large-scale data, real-time applications, and unstructured data.

### When to Use SQL vs. NoSQL

- **Use SQL** when:
  
  - You need complex transactions and queries.
  
  - Your data is structured and relationships are important.
  
  - You require strong consistency and integrity.

- **Use NoSQL** when:
  
  - You are dealing with large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.
  
  - You need high scalability and flexibility.
  
  - Your application requires fast, real-time data processing.

# Module 03 - 146: MongoDB (1)

The original guide explains how to install MongoDB for MAC users but,so that for those Linux users, these steps explains how to set it up.  

Additionally, this guide explains how to install MongoDB without it being system-wide, as well as installing it system-wide.   

I recommend the first option.

****

# Installing MongoDB on Linux

****

## A. Via Docker:

If you want even greater isolation, you can use Docker to run MongoDB in a container.   

This ensures MongoDB doesn’t interact with your system at all.

1. **Install Docker**:
   
   - Follow the official instructions to install Docker: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

2. **Run MongoDB in a Container**:
   
   - Use the following command to start a MongoDB container:
     
     ```bash
     docker run -d --name mongodb-course -p 27017:27017 -v ~/projects/mongodb-course/data/db:/data/db mongo
     ```
- This mounts the `~/projects/mongodb-course/data/db` folder to the container for data persistence.
3. **Connect to the Container**:
   
   - Use the `mongo` shell to connect to the container:
     
     ```bash
     mongo --host 127.0.0.1 --port 27017
     ```

---

## B. Via Sources

### **1. Download MongoDB Binaries**

Instead of installing MongoDB via Docker, you can download the binaries and run them directly from a project folder.

1. **Download MongoDB**:
   
   - Go to the [MongoDB Community Download Page](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).
   
   - Select the appropriate version for your Linux distribution and download the `.tgz` file.

2. **Extract the Binaries**:
   
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the folder where you downloaded the `.tgz` file.
   
   - Extract the archive:
     
     ```bash
     tar -xvzf mongodb-linux-x86_64-<version>.tgz
     ```
   
   - Move the extracted folder to your project directory (e.g., `~/projects/mongodb-course`):
     
     ```bash
     mv mongodb-linux-x86_64-<version> ~/projects/mongodb-course/mongodb
     ```

****

### **2. Set Up MongoDB for Your Project**

Now that you have the binaries in your project folder, configure MongoDB to run in an isolated environment.

1. **Create Data and Logs Folders**:
   
   1. MongoDB needs a folder to store data and another for logs. Create these folders inside your project directory:
      
      ```bash
      mkdir -p ~/projects/mongodb-course/data/db
      mkdir -p ~/projects/mongodb-course/logs
      ```

2. **Create a Configuration File**:
   
   1. Create a configuration file (`mongod.conf`) in your project folder:
      
      ```bash
      nano ~/projects/mongodb-course/mongod.conf
      ```
   
   2. Add the following basic configuration:
      
      ```bash
      storage:
        dbPath: /home/<your-username>/projects/mongodb-course/data/db
      systemLog:
        destination: file
        path: /home/<your-username>/projects/mongodb-course/logs/mongod.log
        logAppend: true
      net:
        bindIp: 127.0.0.1
        port: 27017
      ```
   
   3. Save and close the file.

****

### **3. Run MongoDB**

You can now start MongoDB from your project folder.

1. **Start the MongoDB Server**:
   
   * Navigate to the `bin` folder inside the extracted MongoDB directory:
     
     ```bash
     cd ~/projects/mongodb-course/mongodb/bin
     ```
   
   * Start the MongoDB server using the configuration file:
     
     ```bash
     ./mongod --config ~/projects/mongodb-course/mongod.conf
     ```

2. **Verify MongoDB is Running**:
   
   * Open another terminal and connect to MongoDB using the `mongo` shell:
     
     ```bash
     ./mongo --host 127.0.0.1 --port 27017
     ```
   
   * If the connection is successful, you’ll see the MongoDB shell prompt.

****

### **4. Stop MongoDB**

When you’re done working with MongoDB, stop the server by pressing `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where it’s running.

****

### **5. Using MongoDB in Your Project**

Now that MongoDB is running, you can use it for your project. Here are some basic commands to get started:

#### **Create a Database**

```bash
use mydatabase
```

#### **Create a Collection**

```bash
db.createCollection("mycollection")
```

#### **Insert a Document**

```bash
db.mycollection.insertOne({ name: "Alice", age: 25 })
```

#### **Query Documents**

```bash
db.mycollection.find({ age: { $gt: 20 } })
```

#### **Delete a Database**

```bash
db.dropDatabase()
```

****

### **6. Clean Up**

When you’re done with the course, simply delete the project folder to remove MongoDB:

```bash
rm -rf ~/projects/mongodb-course
```

If you used Docker, stop and remove the container:

```bash
docker stop mongodb-course
docker rm mongodb-course
```

****

# C. Via apt, SYSTEM-WIDE (Be careful)

### Step 1: Install MongoDB

To install MongoDB, use the package manager of your distribution:

- **Debian/Ubuntu:**  `sudo apt update & sudop apt install -y mongodb`
- **Fedora**:  `sudo dnf install -y mongodb`
- **Arch Linux (AUR package available):** `yay -S mongodb-bin`

### Step 3: Create the Data Directory

MongoDB stores its data in `/data/db`. You need to create this directory manually:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /data/db
sudo chown -R `id -un` /data/db
```

### Step 4: Start MongoDB

To start the MongoDB daemon, run:

```bash
mongod
```

You can verify if MongoDB is running by opening a new terminal and typing:  

```bash
mongo
```

If everything is set up correctly, this will open the MongoDB shell.

# Module 03-147: MongoDB (2)

## Creating a MongoDB Database Along with Admin Database Users

---

## **Index**

1. Starting MongoDB
2. Listing Existing Databases
3. Creating a New Database
4. Understanding the `db` Object
5. Creating a Database User
6. Listing Users in a Database
7. Deleting a User

---

## **Prerequisites**

Before proceeding, ensure you have MongoDB installed and properly configured on your system. You will need to have the **MongoDB daemon** (`mongod`) running and access to the **MongoDB shell** (`mongo`).

### **Starting MongoDB**

To start the MongoDB daemon, open your terminal and run:

```bash
mongod
```

Then, open a new terminal tab or window and enter the MongoDB shell:

```bash
mongo
```

If everything is working correctly, you should see a prompt similar to:

```
MongoDB shell version vX.X.X
connecting to: mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/test
```

---

## **Listing Existing Databases**

To view the databases currently available on your system, run:

```bash
show dbs
```

Example output:

```
administration  0.000GB
test            0.000GB
```

If you have been working with MongoDB before, you might see additional databases listed.

---

## **Creating a New Database**

To create a new database, use the `use` command followed by the database name:

```bash
use mongoCourse
```

Expected output:

```
switched to db mongoCourse
```

> **Note:** The new database **will not** appear in `show dbs` until at least one document has been inserted.

---

## **Understanding the `db` Object**

MongoDB provides a special object `db`, which always refers to the current active database. To check which database you are in, simply type:

```bash
db
```

Expected output:

```
mongoCourse
```

This confirms that all further operations will be performed on `mongoCourse`.

---

## **Creating a Database User**

Official MongoDB Documentation: 

Database users are essential for managing access control. To create a new user, execute the following JavaScript code inside the MongoDB shell:

```js
db.createUser({
  user: 'jordan',
  pwd: 'securepassword',
  customData: { startDate: new Date() },
  roles: [
    { role: 'clusterAdmin', db: 'admin' },
    { role: 'readAnyDatabase', db: 'admin' },
    'readWrite'
  ]
})
```

### **Explanation:**

- `user`: The username for the new user.
- `pwd`: The password (ensure you use a strong password in production environments).
- `customData`: Optional metadata, e.g., a timestamp for when the user was created.
- `roles`: Defines the users permissions:
  - `clusterAdmin`: Grants cluster-wide administrative privileges.
  - `readAnyDatabase`: Allows reading from any database.
  - `readWrite`: Provides read and write access to the current database.

---

## **Listing Users in a Database**

To see all users associated with the current database, use:

```bash
db.getUsers()
```

Expected output:

```json
[
  {
    "_id": "mongoCourse.jordan",
    "user": "jordan",
    "roles": [
      { "role": "clusterAdmin", "db": "admin" },
      { "role": "readAnyDatabase", "db": "admin" },
      "readWrite"
    ]
  }
]
```

This confirms that our user `jordan` has been successfully created with the specified roles.

---

## **Deleting a User**

If you need to remove a user from the database, run:

```bash
db.dropUser('jordan')
```

Expected output:

```
true
```

To verify, check the list of users again:

```bash
db.getUsers()
```

The removed user should no longer appear in the output.

---

## **Review and Best Practices**

- **Ensure the MongoDB daemon (`mongod`) is running** before performing any database operations.
- **Use strong passwords** when creating database users, especially in production environments.
- **Regularly check user permissions** using `db.getUsers()`.
- **Do not rely solely on default roles**—customize roles based on security and access control needs.
- **Remember that a new database will not be listed** until at least one document has been inserted.

# Module 03-148: MongoDB (3)

## Collections

---

## **Index**

1. Understanding Collections
2. Creating a Collection
3. Listing Collections
4. Understanding System Indexes
5. 

---

## **Understanding Collections**

In MongoDB, collections are the equivalent of tables in relational databases. Collections store multiple documents, which are JSON-like objects containing data. Unlike tables, collections do not enforce a rigid schema, allowing flexibility in storing various data structures.

### **Key Differences Between Collections and SQL Tables:**

| Feature     | SQL Table        | MongoDB Collection |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| Structure   | Fixed schema     | Schema-less        |
| Rows        | Records          | Documents          |
| Columns     | Fields           | Fields (flexible)  |
| Data Format | Structured (SQL) | JSON-like (BSON)   |

---

## **Creating a Collection**

To create a new collection in MongoDB, use the `createCollection` method:

```js
 db.createCollection("books")
```

### **Expected Output:**

```json
{ "ok" : 1 }
```

This response confirms that the collection was successfully created.

> **Note:** Unlike relational databases, MongoDB automatically creates a collection when the first document is inserted. Explicitly using `createCollection` is only necessary for advanced configurations.

---

## **Listing Collections**

To view all collections within the current database, run:

```js
show collections
```

### **Example Output:**

```
books
system.indexes
```

This output shows that the database contains a `books` collection, along with `system.indexes` (used for indexing documents).

---

## **Understanding System Indexes**

MongoDB automatically maintains a `system.indexes` collection, which stores index metadata. Indexes improve query performance by enabling efficient lookups.

> **Tip:** While you don't need to manage `system.indexes` directly, understanding how indexes work can help optimize performance. Learn more in the [MongoDB Indexing Guide](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/indexes/).

---

## **Best Practices**

- **Let MongoDB create collections automatically** when inserting documents unless specific configurations are required.
- **Use meaningful collection names** (e.g., `users`, `orders`, `logs`).
- **Avoid excessively large collections** without indexing, as performance may degrade.
- **Leverage indexing strategies** to speed up queries and enhance efficiency.

## **Index**

1. Understanding MongoDB Documents

2. Inserting a Single Document

3. Inserting Multiple Documents

4. Handling Flexible Schema

5. 

---

## **Understanding MongoDB Documents**

MongoDB stores data in **documents**, which are JSON-like objects consisting of key-value pairs. Unlike traditional SQL databases, MongoDB **does not enforce a schema**, allowing documents in the same collection to have different structures.

Each document is stored in a **collection**, which functions similarly to tables in relational databases.

---

## **Inserting a Single Document**

To insert a single document into the `books` collection, use `insertOne()`. This function expects a **JSON object**.

```
// Insert a single book documentdb.books.insertOne({  "name": "OOP Programming",  "publishedDate": new Date(),  "authors": [    { "name": "Jon Snow" },    { "name": "Ned Stark" }  ]})
```

### **Expected Output:**

```
{ "acknowledged": true, "insertedId": "ObjectId('...')" }
```

> **Note:** `ObjectId` is a unique identifier automatically generated for each document.

---

## **Inserting Multiple Documents**

To insert multiple records at once, use `insertMany()` with an **array** of JSON objects.

```
// Insert multiple book documentsdb.books.insertMany([  {    "name": "JavaScript Essentials",    "publishedDate": new Date("2023-01-01"),    "authors": [ { "name": "Alice Johnson" } ]  },  {    "name": "Mastering Databases",    "publishedDate": new Date("2022-05-10"),    "authors": [ { "name": "Bob Smith" }, { "name": "Charlie Brown" } ]  }])
```

### **Expected Output:**

```
{ "acknowledged": true, "insertedIds": [ "ObjectId('...')", "ObjectId('...')" ] }
```

---

## **Handling Flexible Schema**

MongoDB allows **dynamic schema changes**. Documents in the same collection do not need to have identicals structures.

Example:

```
// Inserting books with different fieldsdb.books.insertMany([  { "name": "Data Science 101", "category": "Technology" },  { "title": "Machine Learning", "publishedYear": 2023 }])
```

> **Caution:** Schema inconsistency can cause issues when querying and managing data.

---

## **Best Practices**

- **Define a standard document structure** for consistency.

- **Use meaningful field names** that align with your data.

- Leverage indexes to optimize query performance.

- **Validate data** before insertion to prevent inconsistencies.

# MODULE 03-150: MongoDB (5)

## Inserting Multiple Documents in MongoDB

---

## **Index**

1. Understanding Document Insertion
2. The `insertMany()` Method
3. Example Usage
4. Return Values and Inserted IDs
5. 

---

## **Understanding Document Insertion**

In MongoDB, documents are stored in collections, and each document follows a flexible schema. Inserting data into a collection is one of the most common operations. MongoDB provides different methods to insert documents, including:

- **`insertOne()`**: Used for inserting a single document.
- **`insertMany()`**: Used for inserting multiple documents at once.

In the previous guide, we covered `insertOne()`. Now, we'll focus on `insertMany()`, which allows for batch insertion of documents in an efficient manner.

---

## **The `insertMany()` Method**

The `insertMany()` method enables bulk insertion of documents into a MongoDB collection. Unlike `insertOne()`, which only takes a single document, `insertMany()` accepts an **array** of documents.

### **Syntax:**

```js
 db.collection.insertMany([
    { document1 },
    { document2 },
    { document3 }
 ])
```

### **Key Points:**

- Each document inside the array must follow valid **BSON** format.
- The method returns metadata, including the `acknowledged` status and a list of inserted **ObjectId** values.
- MongoDB automatically assigns a unique **_id** field to each document if not explicitly provided.

For official documentation, refer to [MongoDB `insertMany()` documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.collection.insertMany/).

---

## **Example Usage**

Let's insert multiple book records into a **books** collection using `insertMany()`:

```js
db.books.insertMany([
  {
    "name": "Confident Ruby",
    "publishedDate": new Date(),
    "authors": [
      { "name": "Avdi Grimm" }
    ]
  },
  {
    "name": "The War of Art",
    "publishedDate": new Date(),
    "authors": [
      { "name": "Steven Pressfield" }
    ]
  },
  {
    "name": "Blink",
    "publishedDate": new Date(),
    "authors": [
      { "name": "Malcolm Gladwell" }
    ]
  }
])
```

This command inserts **three** books into the collection.

---

## **Return Values and Inserted IDs**

Upon execution, `insertMany()` returns a confirmation object:

```json
{
  "acknowledged": true,
  "insertedIds": {
    "0": ObjectId("60c5f3a3b2b8d59e1a56a2b1"),
    "1": ObjectId("60c5f3a3b2b8d59e1a56a2b2"),
    "2": ObjectId("60c5f3a3b2b8d59e1a56a2b3")
  }
}
```

### **Key Details:**

- **`acknowledged: true`** → Confirms that the operation was successful.
- **`insertedIds`** → Provides unique MongoDB ObjectIDs for each document inserted.
- ObjectIDs are unique and allow efficient document retrieval.

---

## **Best Practices**

### ✅ **Use `insertMany()` for Bulk Insertions**

Instead of inserting documents one at a time, use `insertMany()` to improve efficiency and reduce database load.

### ✅ **Ensure Consistency in Document Structure**

Although MongoDB is schema-less, maintaining a consistent structure across documents simplifies queries and indexing.

### ✅ **Monitor Performance for Large Bulk Inserts**

For **very large** insertions, consider breaking them into smaller batches to avoid excessive memory usage.

### ✅ **Avoid Duplicate Entries**

MongoDB does not enforce uniqueness unless explicitly defined using **unique indexes**.

```js
db.books.createIndex({ name: 1 }, { unique: true })
```

This ensures that no two books share the same name.

For more details, see [MongoDB Indexing Documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/indexes/).

# MODULE 03-151: MongoDB (6)

## Querying Documents with `find()` Method

---

## **Index**

1. Understanding the `find()` Method

2. Using `find().pretty()` for Better Readability

3. MongoDB vs SQL: Querying All Documents

4. Automatic Object IDs in MongoDB

---

So far, we have focused primarily on inserting documents into MongoDB collections. However, retrieving and querying data is just as important. MongoDB provides various methods to retrieve data efficiently, with the `find()` method being the most fundamental.

In this guide, we will explore how to use `find()` to query documents and compare its functionality to SQL-based queries. We will also discuss MongoDB's automatic Object ID generation.

---

## **Understanding the** `**find()**` **Method**

The `find()` method in MongoDB is used to retrieve documents from a collection. It works similarly to the `SELECT` statement in SQL, allowing users to fetch data that matches specific criteria. By default, calling `find()` without any parameters returns all documents in the collection.

### **Syntax:**

```
// Retrieve all documents in a collection db.books.find()
```

### **Example Output:**

```
{ "_id" : ObjectId("507f191e810c19729de860ea"), "name" : "Confident Ruby", "publishedDate" : ISODate("2023-01-01T00:00:00Z") }{ "_id" : ObjectId("507f191e810c19729de860eb"), "name" : "The War of Art", "publishedDate" : ISODate("2023-01-02T00:00:00Z") }
```

---

## **Using** `**find().pretty()**` **for Better Readability**

MongoDB allows us to improve the readability of query results using the `pretty()` method. This method formats the output in an easily readable JSON structure.

### **Syntax:**

```
// Retrieve and format all documents db.books.find().pretty()
```

### **Example Output:**

```
[  {    "_id": ObjectId("507f191e810c19729de860ea"),    "name": "Confident Ruby",    "publishedDate": ISODate("2023-01-01T00:00:00Z")  },  {    "_id": ObjectId("507f191e810c19729de860eb"),    "name": "The War of Art",    "publishedDate": ISODate("2023-01-02T00:00:00Z")  }]
```

Using `pretty()` makes it easier to read and analyze large sets of documents in the database.

---

## **MongoDB vs SQL: Querying All Documents**

For users coming from a relational database background, it is useful to compare MongoDB’s `find()` method with SQL queries.

| Operation              | MongoDB Query     | SQL Equivalent         |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| Retrieve all documents | `db.books.find()` | `SELECT * FROM books;` |

This comparison helps in understanding MongoDB’s document-oriented approach in contrast to SQL’s table-based structure.

---

## **Automatic Object IDs in MongoDB**

MongoDB automatically generates a unique identifier (`_id`) for each document. This field acts similarly to a **primary key** in SQL databases and is crucial for uniquely identifying each document.

### **Example Document with Object ID:**

```
{  "_id": ObjectId("507f191e810c19729de860ea"),  "name": "Confident Ruby",  "publishedDate": ISODate("2023-01-01T00:00:00Z")}
```

### **Key Points:**

- The `_id` field is automatically added if not specified.

- It ensures each document is uniquely identifiable.

- Object IDs contain encoded timestamp information, making them useful for tracking document creation times.

## Querying a Specific Document in Collections

---

## **Index**

1. Querying a Specific Document

2. Handling Multiple Matches

3. Comparing MongoDB and SQL Queries

---

In many real-world scenarios, retrieving all documents is inefficient. Instead, we often need to query for a specific document based on a field value. MongoDB provides the `find()` method, which allows filtering documents by specific criteria.

In this guide, we will explore how to query a single document in MongoDB using `find()`, handle multiple matches, and compare it with SQL queries.

---

## **Querying a Specific Document**

To retrieve a specific document, we pass a query object to `find()`. This object specifies the condition the document must meet.

### **Syntax:**

```js
// Query a book by name

db.books.find({ name: "OOP Programming" }).pretty()
```

### **Example Output:**

```json
[  
    {    
        "_id": ObjectId("507f191e810c19729de860ec"),    
        "name": "OOP Programming",    
        "publishedDate": ISODate("2023-03-15T00:00:00Z"),    
        "authors": [      
                        { "name": "John Doe" },      
                        { "name": "Jane Doe" }    
                    ]  
    }
]
```

This query returns only documents where the `name` field matches "OOP Programming".

---

## **Handling Multiple Matches**

The `find()` method returns **all** matching documents. If multiple documents have the same `name`, they will all be included in the output.

### **Example:**

```javascript
// Query multiple documents with the same name

db.books.find({ name: "OOP Programming" }).pretty()
```

If multiple books exist with the same title, the result will contain all of them. This behavior is different from SQL, where primary keys ensure unique values.

To retrieve only the first matching document, use `findOne()`:

```js
// Retrieve only the first matching document

db.books.findOne({ name: "OOP Programming" })
```

This ensures that only **one** document is returned, even if multiple matches exist.

---

## **Comparing MongoDB and SQL Queries**

For those familiar with SQL, the equivalent of MongoDB’s `find()` method is the `SELECT` statement with a `WHERE` clause.

| Operation                        | MongoDB Query                                   | SQL Equivalent                                                |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Find a document by name          | `db.books.find({ name: "OOP Programming" })`    | `SELECT * FROM books WHERE name = 'OOP Programming';`         |
| Find the first matching document | `db.books.findOne({ name: "OOP Programming" })` | `SELECT * FROM books WHERE name = 'OOP Programming' LIMIT 1;` |

# MODULE 03-153: MongoDB (8)

## Introduction to Projections

---

## **Index**

1. Understanding Projections in MongoDB

2. Using Projections with the `find()` Method

3. Including and Excluding Fields

4. MongoDB vs SQL: Projection Queries

---

By default, when querying a MongoDB collection using the `find()` method, all fields of a document are returned. However, in most cases, retrieving all attributes is unnecessary and inefficient, especially in large datasets.

**Projections** in MongoDB allow you to specify which fields should be included or excluded from the query results.

In this guide, we will explore how to use projections in MongoDB queries to retrieve only the necessary fields efficiently.

---

## **Understanding Projections in MongoDB**

A **projection** is a specification of the fields that should be included or excluded in the query results. This helps optimize performance by reducing the amount of data transferred from the database.

### **Why Use Projections?**

- Improves query performance by reducing data retrieval size.

- Helps prevent over-fetching unnecessary data.

- Optimizes network bandwidth and response time.

---

## **Using Projections with the** `**find()**` **Method**

The `find()` method in MongoDB accepts two parameters:

1. **Query object** - Specifies the selection criteria.

2. **Projection object** - Specifies the fields to include or exclude.

### **Syntax:**

```js
// Find documents with projection

 db.books.find(
   { name: "Confident Ruby" }, // Query
   { name: 1, authors: 1, _id: 0 } // Projection
 ).pretty()
```

### **Example Output:**

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Confident Ruby",
    "authors": [
      { "name": "Avdi Grimm" }
    ]
  }
]
```

The projection `{ name: 1, authors: 1, _id: 0 }` specifies that only the `name` and `authors` fields should be returned while excluding `_id`.

---

## **Including and Excluding Fields**

MongoDB allows **two approaches** for projections:

### **1. Including Specific Fields**

Set the desired fields to `1` (except for `_id`, which is included by default unless excluded explicitly).

#### **Example:**

```js
// Return only the name and authors fields

 db.books.find({}, { name: 1, authors: 1 }).pretty()
```

### **2. Excluding Specific Fields**

Set the fields to `0` to remove them from the results.

#### **Example:**

```js
// Exclude the publishedDate field

 db.books.find({}, { publishedDate: 0 }).pretty()
```

### **Note:**

- You **cannot mix** inclusion (`1`) and exclusion (`0`) in the same query, **except for** `**_id**`.

- If no projection is specified, all fields are returned by default.

---

## **MongoDB vs SQL: Projection Queries**

| **Operation**          | **MongoDB Query**                            | **SQL Equivalent**                 |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Select specific fields | `db.books.find({}, { name: 1, authors: 1 })` | `SELECT name, authors FROM books;` |
| Exclude a field        | `db.books.find({}, { publishedDate: 0 })`    | `SELECT name, authors FROM books;` |

## Querying for a Portion of a Nested Array Element using `$slice`

---

## **Index**

1. Understanding the `$slice` Operator

2. Using `$slice` in Queries

3. Examples of `$slice` Projections

4. MongoDB vs SQL: Handling Nested Arrays

---

When working with MongoDB, we often deal with **nested arrays** inside documents. By default, querying a document with an array field will return all elements of that array. However, there are cases where we may only want to retrieve a portion of the array rather than the full dataset.

MongoDB provides the `**$slice**` operator to limit the number of elements returned from an array field. This guide will explain how to use `$slice` to refine query results efficiently.

---

## **Understanding the** `**$slice**` **Operator**

The `$slice` operator allows retrieving a subset of an array field when querying documents. It is used within the **projection object** of the `find()` method.

### **Key Features of** `**$slice**`**:**

- Limits the number of array elements returned.

- Can return elements from the beginning, end, or a specified range within the array.

- Helps reduce data transfer size when working with large datasets.

---

## **Using** `**$slice**` **in Queries**

The `$slice` operator is used within the projection part of the `find()` method.

### **Syntax:**

```js
// Retrieve only the first N elements of an array field

 db.books.find(
   { name: "Blink" }, // Query condition
   { authors: { $slice: 1 } } // Projection using `$slice`
 ).pretty()
```

### **Example Document:**

```json
ç{
  "name": "Blink",
  "publishedDate": "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "authors": [
    { "name": "Malcolm Gladwell" },
    { "name": "Ghost Writer" }
  ]
}
```

The above query will return only the **first author** from the `authors` array.

---

## **Examples of** `**$slice**` **Projections**

### **Retrieving the First Element**

```js
// Return only the first author

 db.books.find(
   { name: "Blink" },
   { authors: { $slice: 1 } }
 ).pretty()
```

### **Retrieving the Last Element**

```js
// Return only the last author

 db.books.find(
   { name: "Blink" },
   { authors: { $slice: -1 } }
 ).pretty()
```

### **Retrieving Multiple Elements from the Start**

```js
// Return the first two authors

 db.books.find(
   { name: "Blink" },
   { authors: { $slice: 2 } }
 ).pretty()
```

---

## **MongoDB vs SQL: Handling Nested Arrays**

In SQL-based databases, handling nested array structures typically requires **JOIN operations** or **subqueries**.   

However, MongoDB’s `$slice` operator provides a simpler, built-in solution for retrieving partial array data efficiently.

| **Operation**                         | **MongoDB Query**                                               | **SQL Equivalent**                                          |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Retrieve first N elements of an array | `db.books.find({ name: "Blink" }, { authors: { $slice: 1 } })`  | No direct equivalent (requires **JOINs** or **subqueries**) |
| Retrieve last element of an array     | `db.books.find({ name: "Blink" }, { authors: { $slice: -1 } })` | No direct equivalent                                        |

## How to Delete Documents in MongoDB

---

## **Index**

1. Understanding Document Deletion in MongoDB

2. Using the `remove()` Method

3. Deleting a Specific Document

4. Deleting Multiple Documents

5. MongoDB vs SQL: Delete Queries

---

So far, we have explored various methods for inserting and querying documents in MongoDB.   

However, managing a database also involves removing unwanted or obsolete documents. In this guide, we will focus on how to **delete documents** efficiently using MongoDB's built-in methods.

---

## **Understanding Document Deletion in MongoDB**

MongoDB provides multiple ways to delete documents:

- `**remove()**` **(Deprecated)** – Previously used to delete documents (replaced by `deleteOne()` and `deleteMany()`).

- `**deleteOne()**` – Removes a single document matching a query.

- `**deleteMany()**` – Removes all documents that match a given query.

Using the appropriate method ensures that only the intended documents are removed while preserving database integrity.

---

## **Using the** `**remove()**` **Method**

> ⚠️ **Note:** The `remove()` method is deprecated and has been replaced by `deleteOne()` and `deleteMany()`. However, we include it here for historical reference.

### **Syntax:**

```js
// Remove all documents that match the query
 db.books.remove({ name: "OOP Programming" })

// Remove only one document that matches the query
 db.books.remove({ name: "OOP Programming" }, 1)
```

---

## **Deleting a Specific Document**

To delete a single document that matches a given filter, use `deleteOne()`.

### **Syntax:**

```js
// Delete one document where name is "OOP Programming"

db.books.deleteOne({ name: "OOP Programming" })
```

### **Example Output:**

```json
{ "acknowledged": true, "deletedCount": 1 }
```

This command removes only **one** matching document, even if multiple exist.

---

## **Deleting Multiple Documents**

To delete **all documents** that match a given query, use `deleteMany()`.

### **Syntax:**

```js
// Delete all documents where name is "OOP Programming"

db.books.deleteMany({ name: "OOP Programming" })
```

### **Example Output:**

```json
{ "acknowledged": true, "deletedCount": 3 }
```

This command removes **all** documents that have `name: "OOP Programming"`.

---

## **MongoDB vs SQL: Delete Queries**

| **Operation**             | **MongoDB Query**                                  | **SQL Equivalent**                                          |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Delete a single document  | `db.books.deleteOne({ name: "OOP Programming" })`  | `DELETE FROM books WHERE name = 'OOP Programming' LIMIT 1;` |
| Delete multiple documents | `db.books.deleteMany({ name: "OOP Programming" })` | `DELETE FROM books WHERE name = 'OOP Programming';`         |

## Including Nested Fields in a find Query

---

## **Index**

1. Working with Nested Fields in MongoDB

2. Querying Specific Nested Fields

3. Using Projections to Limit Nested Data

4. MongoDB vs SQL: Nested Queries

---

MongoDB provides a flexible schema design that allows documents to have **nested fields** and **embedded arrays**.   

This structure is beneficial when working with complex data relationships. However, retrieving specific data from these nested structures requires special querying techniques.  

In this guide, we will explore how to query **specific fields inside nested objects** using projections in MongoDB.  

---

## **Working with Nested Fields in MongoDB**

In MongoDB, documents can contain **nested objects** or **arrays of objects**. This allows data to be stored in a hierarchical manner.

### **Example Document with Nested Fields:**

```json
{
    "name": "Blink",
    "publishedDate": "2024-03-10T10:00:00Z",
    "authors": [
        { "name": "Malcolm Gladwell", "active": true },
        { "name": "Ghost Writer", "active": true }
    ]
}
```

In this example:

- `authors` is an **array** of objects.

- Each object inside `authors` contains `name` and `active` fields.

Retrieving specific nested fields requires **dot notation** (`"parent.child"`).

---

## **Querying Specific Nested Fields**

We can use the `find()` method to retrieve only specific **nested fields** from documents.

### **Syntax:**

```js
// Find books where name is "Blink" and return only the authors' names  

db.books.find(
  { name: "Blink" },
  { "authors.name": 1 }
).pretty()
```

### **Example Output:**

```json
{
    "_id": ObjectId("65f9c3e45a2b1e4d8e52f654"),
    "authors": [
        { "name": "Malcolm Gladwell" },
        { "name": "Ghost Writer" }
    ]
}
```

Here, only the `name` field inside the `authors` array is returned, **excluding** the `active` field.

---

## **Using Projections to Limit Nested Data**

Projections allow us to control which **nested fields** are included or excluded in query results.

### **Example:** Excluding `_id` and Returning Only Specific Fields

```js
// Return only the book name and authors' names, excluding _id  

db.books.find(
  { name: "Blink" },
  {
    _id: 0,
    name: 1,
    "authors.name": 1
  }
).pretty()
```

### **Example Output:**

```json
{
    "name": "Blink",
    "authors": [
        { "name": "Malcolm Gladwell" },
        { "name": "Ghost Writer" }
    ]
}
```

### **Key Notes:**

- `_id: 0` explicitly **excludes** the `_id` field.

- `name: 1` includes the `name` field of the book.

- `"authors.name": 1` retrieves only the `name` field inside the `authors` array.

# MODULE 03-157: MongoDB (12)

## Using the `findOne` Method in MongoDB

---

## **Index**

1. Understanding the `findOne` Method
2. Using `findOne` to Retrieve a Single Document
3. Comparing `find()` vs `findOne()`
4. MongoDB vs SQL: Single Record Query

---

When querying a MongoDB collection, sometimes you need to retrieve only a single document rather than multiple results. MongoDB provides the `findOne()` method, which is designed to return the first document that matches a given query.

This guide will explain how `findOne()` works, its differences compared to `find()`, and how it can be leveraged in applications where retrieving a single record is necessary.

---

## **Understanding the `findOne` Method**

MongoDB’s `findOne()` method is used to return the **first** document that matches a given query. If no matching document is found, it returns `null`.

### **Syntax:**

```js
// Basic findOne query

 db.collection.findOne({ query })
```

The key difference between `findOne()` and `find()` is that `findOne()` **only returns a single document** instead of a cursor containing multiple documents.

---

## **Using `findOne` to Retrieve a Single Document**

Consider a `books` collection with multiple documents:

```js
db.books.find({ name: "Blink" })
```

If multiple documents match the query, all will be returned. However, using `findOne()`, only the first matching document will be retrieved:

```js
db.books.findOne({ name: "Blink" })
```

### **Example Output:**

```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId("507f1f77bcf86cd799439011"),
  "name": "Blink",
  "publishedDate": "2023-05-14T00:00:00Z",
  "authors": [
    { "name": "Malcolm Gladwell" }
  ]
}
```

**Key Benefits of `findOne()`:**

- Guarantees that only one document is returned.
- Eliminates the need to iterate over multiple documents.
- Useful in applications that require a single result (e.g., retrieving user profiles, fetching configuration settings).

---

## **Comparing `find()` vs `findOne()`**

| Feature            | `find()`                    | `findOne()`               |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Returns            | Cursor (multiple documents) | Single document or `null` |
| Use Case           | Retrieving multiple records | Retrieving one record     |
| Requires Iteration | Yes                         | No                        |
| Default Output     | JSON array                  | JSON object               |

If multiple documents match the query, `findOne()` returns **only the first document** found, whereas `find()` returns a cursor that can contain multiple documents.

---

## **MongoDB vs SQL: Single Record Query**

| **Operation**        | **MongoDB Query**                     | **SQL Equivalent**                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Find a single record | `db.books.findOne({ name: "Blink" })` | `SELECT * FROM books WHERE name = 'Blink' LIMIT 1;` |

In SQL databases, retrieving a single record often involves using the `LIMIT 1` clause, while in MongoDB, `findOne()` handles this automatically.

# MODULE 03-158: MongoDB (13)

## Querying for a Portion of a String in a MongoDB Document

***

1. Understanding String Queries in MongoDB
2. Using Regular Expressions for Partial String Matching
3. Case-Insensitive Queries
4. Comparison with SQL LIKE Operator

---

## **Introduction**

In real-world applications, exact string matching is rarely sufficient. Instead, developers often need to query documents based on **partial string matches**, such as searching for keywords within a larger text field. MongoDB provides **regular expressions (RegEx)** as a powerful tool to perform such queries.

This guide will demonstrate how to use **MongoDB's find() method** with regular expressions to search for a portion of a string inside a document.

---

## **Understanding String Queries in MongoDB**

MongoDB's `find()` method typically retrieves documents where field values match the query exactly. However, when searching for substrings or patterns within a text field, an **exact match is not practical**.

Consider the following document:

```js
{
  "name": "Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World",
  "publishedDate": new Date(),
  "authors": [
    {"name": "Cal Newport"}
  ]
}
```

A **standard** query would require an exact match:

```js
db.books.findOne({ name: "Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World" })
```

This is **not flexible**. If a user searches for just **"Deep Work"**, this query would fail. To overcome this limitation, we use **regular expressions**.

---

## **Using Regular Expressions for Partial String Matching**

MongoDB supports **regular expressions (RegEx)** to search for substrings within a text field. The following query searches for the substring **"Deep Work"** anywhere within the `name` field:

```js
db.books.findOne({ name: /.*deep work.*/i })
```

### **Explanation:**

- `/.*deep work.*/` → Matches any occurrence of "deep work" in the string.
- `.*` → Wildcard characters to match anything before or after "deep work".
- `/i` → Case-insensitive flag (matches "Deep Work" and "deep work").

### **Expected Output:**

```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "name": "Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World",
  "publishedDate": ISODate("2024-02-20T00:00:00Z"),
  "authors": [ {"name": "Cal Newport"} ]
}
```

---

## **Case-Insensitive Queries**

By default, string queries in MongoDB are **case-sensitive**. Using the `/i` flag ensures that searches are case-insensitive.

### **Example:**

Without `/i`:

```js
db.books.findOne({ name: /deep work/ })
```

- This query **fails** if "Deep Work" is capitalized in the document.

With `/i`:

```js
db.books.findOne({ name: /deep work/i })
```

- This query **succeeds**, regardless of capitalization.

---

## **Comparison with SQL LIKE Operator**

The **equivalent SQL query** for partial string matching uses the `LIKE` operator:

| **Operation**    | **MongoDB Query**                          | **SQL Equivalent**                                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Exact Match      | `db.books.findOne({ name: "Deep Work" })`  | `SELECT * FROM books WHERE name = 'Deep Work';`             |
| Partial Match    | `db.books.findOne({ name: /deep work/i })` | `SELECT * FROM books WHERE name LIKE '%deep work%';`        |
| Case-Insensitive | `db.books.findOne({ name: /deep work/i })` | `SELECT * FROM books WHERE LOWER(name) LIKE '%deep work%';` |

Unlike SQL, MongoDB does **not** require explicit `%` wildcards for substring searches. Instead, regular expressions provide more flexibility.

# MODULE 03-159: MongoDB (14)

## How to Check if a Field Exists in a MongoDB Document

---

## **Index**

1. Understanding the Need for Field Existence Checks
2. Using the `$exists` Operator
3. Querying for Documents Where a Field Exists
4. Querying for Documents Where a Field Does Not Exist

---

In MongoDB, documents within the same collection do not have to follow a fixed schema, meaning that some documents may contain fields that others do not. As a result, it is often necessary to check whether a specific field exists in a document before processing it.

This guide explores how to use the `$exists` operator to determine whether a field is present in a MongoDB document.

---

## **Understanding the Need for Field Existence Checks**

Since MongoDB allows flexible document structures, some documents may have fields that others do not. Consider the following example:

- Some books in a `books` collection may have a `reviews` field indicating the number of reviews, while others do not.
- We may need to filter documents based on whether they contain this field.

Using the `$exists` operator, we can efficiently retrieve only those documents that have (or do not have) a particular field.

---

## **Using the `$exists` Operator**

The `$exists` operator is a MongoDB query operator used to check whether a field exists in a document.

### **Syntax:**

```js
{ field: { $exists: <boolean> } }
```

- Setting `$exists` to `true` will return documents where the specified field exists.
- Setting `$exists` to `false` will return documents where the specified field does not exist.

---

## **Querying for Documents Where a Field Exists**

To find all books that include a `reviews` field, use the following query:

```js
db.books.find({ reviews: { $exists: true } })
```

### **Example Output:**

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World",
    "publishedDate": "2024-03-10T00:00:00Z",
    "reviews": 100,
    "authors": [
      { "name": "Cal Newport" }
    ]
  }
]
```

This query retrieves only the documents that include the `reviews` field.

---

## **Querying for Documents Where a Field Does Not Exist**

To find books that do **not** include a `reviews` field, use:

```js
db.books.find({ reviews: { $exists: false } })
```

### **Example Output:**

```json
[
  {
    "name": "The War of Art",
    "publishedDate": "2024-03-10T00:00:00Z",
    "authors": [
      { "name": "Steven Pressfield" }
    ]
  },
  {
    "name": "Blink",
    "publishedDate": "2024-03-10T00:00:00Z",
    "authors": [
      { "name": "Malcolm Gladwell" }
    ]
  }
]
```

This query filters out all books that do contain the `reviews` field.

---

## **Practical Use Cases**

- **Data Integrity Checks:** Identify documents missing expected fields to maintain data consistency.
- **Selective Querying:** Retrieve only documents that include or exclude certain fields.
- **Schema Evolution:** Detect older documents missing newly added fields and update them accordingly.

| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Find documents where `reviews` exists         | `db.books.find({ reviews: { $exists: true } })`  | `SELECT * FROM books WHERE reviews IS NOT NULL;` |
| Find documents where `reviews` does not exist | `db.books.find({ reviews: { $exists: false } })` | `SELECT * FROM books WHERE reviews IS NULL;`     |
