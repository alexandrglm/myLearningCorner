# 07-004 Git/GitHub Setup for React Projects

Specific to React:

- Create a .gitignore file with node_modules (to avoid uploading heavy dependencies)
- Use templates with configuration for Heroku deployment

Basic workflow, as a reminder:
```bash
git init in React project  
Create .gitignore (include node_modules)  
git add . → git commit -m "First commit"  
Connect with remote GitHub repository  
git push to upload code  
```

Key point: GitHub serves as a portfolio for developers – employers review it to see how you write code.
