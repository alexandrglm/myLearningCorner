# 07-003    Fix VS Code extensions

The "JS-CSS-HTML Formatter" extension was causing conflicts with other extensions, generating red lines and strange behaviour.

Solution: Uninstall problematic extensions one by one until the conflict is identified.

Reminder: If VS Code behaves oddly (reorganises code, visual errors), check the extensions.
