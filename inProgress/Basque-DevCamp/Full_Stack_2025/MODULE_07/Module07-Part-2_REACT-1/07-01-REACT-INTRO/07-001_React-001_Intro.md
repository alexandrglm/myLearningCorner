# Module 7 – React Guide 1: React Architecture

https://devcamp.com/pt-full-stack-development-javascript-python-react/guide/react-architecture-overview

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces ([React Architecture Overview](https://devcamp.com/pt-full-stack-development-javascript-python-react/guide/react-architecture-overview)), not a full framework (although it is used as such due to its power). Its architecture is based on **reusable components**.

**Key concepts:**

- **Component-based system**: Instead of multiple separate HTML pages, React organises everything into independent and reusable components
- **A single HTML page**: The entire application runs from a single HTML file where components are loaded dynamically
- **Different methodology**: Shift in mindset from “web pages” to “components” that are displayed or hidden as needed

**Practical example:** Facebook uses React where each element (sidebar, thumbnail, links) is a reusable component that can be used in multiple places.

We will get ready to build a Mad Lib application as the first project, demonstrating how this component-based architecture works in practice.
