# Module 02 - 022: Python (1) - Strings introduction
***
In the last section of the course, we walk through variables and data types inside the Python programming language.   
And in this section I want to take one of those data types the string data type and I want to dissect it.   
  
First, we will begin with the basics such as the different types of strings we can create.   
Then, we will dive into functions, the processes built directly into the language that allows us to manipulate.  
 From here, we will learn to work with strings then build dynamic strings.

This means we will be able to have strings with one value and dynamically slide into other values.   
This will be a skill that you will use during your entire programming career as well as one of the key components of almost any program you work with.   
Beginning with the basics, we will all the way through those advanced topics.
