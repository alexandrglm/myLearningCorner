# MODULE 01 - 076: A design inspiration system

---

**Jordan Hudgens:** And so that's  
 why we're going into it right away and it's because whenever I've tried  
 to design anything whether it's a Web site or a logo or anything like   
that. One of the hardest steps I have is that first one which is I've no  
 idea what to actually design and when I will speak with a number of   
other designers they kind of almost skip over that part a little bit.   
And to me without that, you really can't do anything else.  

 And so I wanted to talk with you and get kind of what your personal system is for  
 getting inspiration. So when I say I need feature X Y Z on [devcamp](https://devcamp.com) how do you know   that it should be this box with these kinds of rounded   
edges and where do you place all the components and just kind of talk to  
 how you get those kinds of ideas for the projects you work on.  

**Jesse Cooke:** Right. Absolutely, this is something   
that I find a lot of designers are kind of hesitant to talk about   
sometimes not with other designers but maybe in a situation like this   
because it's almost like you know you're giving away a little bit of the  
 "secret sauce".   

The concept of looking at other works for inspiration   
is crucial. There's no reason why that's how we are getting better at   
our design than we're iterating and our design is changing, the way apps  
 look today are different than they looked three years ago. And they're   
going to look different three years from now, and everyone is kind of,   
you know developing and we moved from let's go back in time six years  
everything was using what's called skew morphic design.  

If you think of the original iPhone iOS. The notes had the kind of   
fake leather right over the top you know. Everything looked like it was a  
 digital rendition of a physical item. And so the shading, drop shadow,   
everything was like really like pseudo-realistic right. And that's   
called skew morphism. All of a sudden that became really outdated. It   
was iOS 7 when all of a sudden it went totally flat. Like hardly any   
drop shadows. Everything was flat colors hardly any gradients and there   
was really jarring for a lot of people outside the design community   
because inside the design community we already been seeing that happen.   
We'd been seeing Websites doing that and so then IOS did it and the 
world was like I don't like this.  

The reason why Steve Jobs wanted the scheme morphic designed first is  
 that people were not used to working on a smartphone.

 So he wanted a lot of elements of the real world on it.   

So at least people would feel a  little bit safer kind of making that jump   

into the digital realm.  

The reason I bring these things up is that the design is always changing and  
 it's going to start communicating to the public in different ways.  

 We didn't know how to scroll really well when Web sites first came out. 
Everyone is shoving all the content above the fold they were putting it 
in the first 900 pixels because that's how they did it with newspapers.   

Right. Newspapers you put all the big stories up on there.  

And so when we invented Web site it's like oh this is just kind   

of a newspaper on the computer.   

So that's what people try to do and if you go back in 1998  Website is just got all the things like up before you scroll.

**JH:** Absolutely.

**JC:** And then you know we've now hit 2010.   

People figured out that you can scroll and then you start seeing a lot more 
landing pages come up where you can tell a story you know section by 
section by section.   

Design continues to change, so you need to be able to go out see what apps   

are looking like see what Web sites are looking like.   

So the first thing that I do there's two really popular Web sites where designers publish their work.   

They publish it one day to kind of build a following and you know it's like Instagram but just for designs or others there's [Bēhance](https://behance.net/) and there's [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/).

They're both really great. I just bounce back and forth between both 
of them. You're not necessarily going there to say "I'm going to go and 
completely mimic another design".  

 Odds are no one's really designed the exact application that you're doing. Maybe sometimes they have and there's nothing wrong with looking at those and be like "*oh that's interesting they put those settings in this way or they took this action
 in this way that's totally fine"*.    

Sometimes there's an objectively right  answer or way to do something and I've hit things or I'm just like this  is the only right way to do this.   

But then there's a lot of subjectivity in design and so you definitely can kind of pivot and be like I love most of what they did here but there are a few things that 
they could have done differently.   

From a strictly aesthetic perspective,  you're going in and you're looking at you know what kind of color palette are these people using.   

You don't need to reinvent the wheel for a lot of these things so if I'm designing an application and the application has a list with profile photos on the left and some metadata  on the right.

Do you know how many times that's been designed?  

 Like just an index of objects.

So many times. So go and look and be like OK do I go a really strong 
and dark name like username and then like a light-colored thin font off 
to the right.  

 Or do I make them both thin or do I make this blue so that  I know that I can click it?   

So there's a lot of different decisions you  can make.   

As opposed to saying this is the only way that you're going to do this going forward.

No, it's about the process. So the first thing you should do when you  know the type of things that need design you've already gotten through the user experience a lot of times this helps in the user experience as well.   

Like forgot password.   

Can you immediately think of all the screens
 that need to exist for a Forgot Password?   

Do you click and then it says  an e-mail link is on the way or does it say Hey we just texted you a code and here is this. What's that exact process?  

 Go grab your phone, log out of Facebook, and then click forgot password and see how they do it. See how all these other apps are doing it.   

Because then you're getting a really good user experience right there. 

*"Oh, that's a huge pain I had to open my mail on my phone or on my desktop. No, I like the text version better".*

It's such a benefit don't ignore that, to be able to test things out   
and that'll just help you kind of get forward and you're not. I mean   
that's just the right way to do it.  

**JH:** Absolutely, and with that when you know the   
application you're building and the feature set that's definitely one part of it.   

Do you find that when you are not actually going and you 
don't have a specific project in mind do you still just to continually 
learn and find new things?   

Are you still going to those websites just to
 look out of curiosity?

**JC:** Yeah it's like Instagram right.?   

 It's like a social network, and even more so you know I have a bookmark folder, and 
whenever I'm on any website and I like something that they did I'll 
bookmark it. I'm like. **"Oh man, I really like how they showed this 
testimonial"*.  

The next time I'm designing the Web site I'm going to come
 and look at this testimonial, right?  

 So I'm always saving stuff that I like. I take pictures of patterns I like out in the real world just like  oh this could be a cool background pattern.   

Definitely, when I see apps  that I really like the design, a perfect example is Venmo versus the cash app, by Square.  

 Two very different interfaces. And personally I 
just love the cash app and so I use it because that's the design I like.  
 But you can compare that and you can be like *"OK you know Venmo is going
 for this and cash is going for this.·*

Why?  

 They obviously maybe made a decision of why to do this type of   
design and why they did this type of design. You're just constantly   
adding to that mental portfolio especially because a big tool you have   
to solve problems both in user experience but also definitely in user   
interface is precedence.   

Whenever you hit a point it's so helpful if you
 have a problem like *"How am I going to design that?"* if you've just got
 something logged in your head. It's just like oh I know snap chat does 
something like this.  

And you can go to that and you can look at the precedents and you can  
 see if that worked well or worked poorly. It gives you just like such a  
 foothold and you're not just like spinning your tires all the time.  

**JH:** That's huge. That's one of the biggest points on  
 why I wanted to include this guide in the entire course and to me, this  
 is actually one of the most important things that everyone will take   
away from the course because I personally feel especially when I was     
younger and I was really struggling with coming up with design ideas   
because there would be so many times I'd be the only developer on a   
project which I did do everything, not just the web application but also  
 the logo and the color scheme and everything.  

I always had this mindset that I needed in order to build a good   
design it all needed to be done from scratch. It had to be one of a   
kind. I couldn't look at anything else. This had to be just something   
that came out of nothing.  

**JC:** Yeah.  

**JH:** And that never turned out well.  

You know we haven't even talked about that. You know there are the   
apples of the world and those types of people. They have a lot of   
thought processes and they spent tens of millions of dollars in   
researching what makes a good user interface and to simply ignore that   
is irresponsible.  

**JC:** it really is.  

**JH:** learning from all of the work that's been done   
by people who've been doing this for a very long time. That's a very   
critical component of it. And if we skip past that we're constantly   
going to be running into the same problems over and over again where we   
just kind of get stuck and can't really build something that feels   
professional.  

**JC:** Right, take for example Snapchat, and then all   
of a sudden Facebook comes out with a very similar feature on Instagram   
and then adds that live streaming to its Facebook platform or the live   
streaming on Facebook, compare that to Meerkat or periscope things like   
that. They look extremely similar.   

Why? Because there's a lot of objectively correct ways to do things in there.   

It's like they're going  to look really similar because to make it look different would just make it worse.   

There's just certain things, think about whether we just have  
 hearts come up underneath or do we have comments that also come up   
underneath.

If you look at Facebook live streaming and Periscope it's really 
close.  

 Facebook has come over from the right and Periscope had them come
 up from underneath.   

It's so nuanced and close but it's like how else are you supposed to do it.   

There's nothing wrong with looking at how other people are doing it and then making a decision is that the right way. Is that the wrong way.   

Is there a subjectively different way that could be just as good?  

 Yeah! But if you're not even looking at it because you're scared that you may be copying something then you're doing yourself a huge disservice.

**JH:** I think that is 100% accurate.   

Some homework for  you as students going through this is before you even go on to the next  guide.   

I definitely recommend for you to go to a few of those 
applications like [dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) and be hands-on with these so that you can start to see what's out there.   

When Jessie originally showed those to me because that was not really the 
part of the world I dove into.  

 I was absolutely fascinated. It was like all of these different screens and concepts of the very talented designers are coming up with, those are things I could learn from and 
those are things that like you said you can develop that mental 
portfolio those things that whenever I start to think about a new 
feature or some new page that I need to create all of a sudden I'm not 
starting from scratch I'm able to leverage what I've learned from others
 especially others that have been doing that for a very long time.

Have fun looking at those sites and we'll see you in the next guide.
