# Module 02 - 068: Python - Lists of Nested Dictionaries



****

## Video lesson Speech

In this lesson, we're going to combine a number of the various techniques that we've worked through in both the list section and the dictionary section.  

 And so we're going to see how you can use both and how one collection can store another one.

****

Now we've talked about nested collections 
before but I felt like it was so important because this is going to be 
something that you're working with on a daily basis whether you're 
working and building out web and mobile applications or if you're 
working on the machine learning side you're going to have nested 
collections and being able to understand exactly what that structure 
looks like. And also very importantly how to traverse those nested 
collections you're going to see that that is going to be very helpful in
 your development career.

So let's build out our team's database here because this is going to 
be very similar to what you're going to get back when you run a database
 query. So I'm gonna say teams and this is going to be a list that 
contains various dictionaries so far we've talked about when we talked 
about nested collections we had lists inside of the value component of 
dictionaries but now we're going to change it up a little bit and we're 
going to create a list of teams and this is going to be a list where 
every element inside of this team's list is going to be a dictionary.

So I'm going to start off with first the list syntax and then we're 
going to create some keys. I'm going to create two because any more than
 that that there's going to be a lot of typing I don't think you want to
 watch me do that. And so here we have right now teams that has to list 
items no keys or values are inside of these items but now we can start 
building that out. I want the key for each one of these dictionaries to 
be the name of the team.

So inside the first one, I'm going to say Astro's and then I want the
 Astro's value to actually be another dictionary. And so in order to do 
that, I'm going to use this syntax right here

![large](02-068_IMG1.png)

and in case whatever development environment you're working on 
doesn't have this kind of autocompletion we can just kind of review here
 there. Whenever you have an open curly bracket you always have to close
 it off. So we have one dictionary here(Teams) and then for Astro's, we 
have the colon. So Astro's is the key and then we have a second 
dictionary nested inside of it here and now let's set up some key-value 
pairs.

I'm going to say Second base is going to be Altuve then shortstop is 
going to be Correa and let's go with one more third base is going to be 
Bregman. So that is our nested dictionary. So once again we have teams 
which is a list. This list contains multiple dictionaries and each one 
of these dictionaries contains a single key-value pair where the key is 
the name and then inside of that contains all of these various elements.

Now we're not limited to only having this one value we could also do 
other elements so we could create another one in here that says 
something like ticket sales and then put a value in that we're not going
 to do that right now. I'm happy with just having one element here. And 
so let's copy this and paste it in over here and I'm also going to fix 
the indentation. So right now we need to actually put our curly brackets
 and close them off and now we have two elements that are identical so 
let's build this out of angels and I'm only going to put two in here so 
we're going to go with outfield and DH. And here we can go with Trout 
and Pujols and these are our teams and we have now multiple levels of 
nesting.

![large](02-068_IMG2.png)

And if this looks weird to you or looks cumbersome I highly recommend  for you to build multiple of these out.   

Use different kinds of case studies and examine exactly how you can structure nested collections like this.  

 Because I can tell you this is going to be very similar to how you're going to work with API data with database queries anything like that you're going to have to become familiar with using and querying these types of nested collections.

So, now that we have that we can just make sure that our syntax is right and we don't have any errors so I'm just going to print out teams and if I do that you can see everything worked

![large](02-068_IMG3.png)

we have **this list that contains multiple dictionaries inside** of it so everything there is working well now that we know we have a list.

We can treat it like a traditional list so if I want to grab just the Astros I can treat teams like a list and just grab that first element by using brackets and then passing in the index value.   

Astro's is the first one listed.  

 So that means they have an index value of 0 and so if I run this you can see we have our Astro's team exactly like how we structured it here where it returned a dictionary and inside of that dictionary is a single key-value pair where the key is a string and then
 the value is this nested dictionary.

![large](02-068_IMG4.png)

So, now let's extend this a little bit further.

Let's now grab the angels and you give us some more space and I'm going to create a 
variable called Angels and we're going to set this equal to teams 1 because we know that the Angel's because it's the second element, has an index value of 1 and then from there let's use our get functions.   

I'm going to say get angels and let's set up a default because we're good developers that want to make sure we don't run into errors and say the default is "team not found" and now let's just print it out so I can print out angels and see if this works and it does

![large](02-068_IMG5.png)

Right here we have the value which contains our outfielder and our D.H. and I'm also going to comment out `print(teams[0])` just so we don't get any of the output confused. 

## Getting by `.values()`

So now that you see the structure that gets printed out. Let's see how we can go and we can 
grab these values.

So I can say something like values and this is going to return a 
dictionary view object of the name. So here we have Trout and Pujols

![large](02-068_IMG6.png)

## Getting the values, but listed `list()`

and if you remember we want to just simply grab the elements and treat it like a list we can just say list and run it again. Now we're at
 Trout and Pujols

![large](02-068_IMG7.png)

and if we just want Pujols' name we can treat it like a traditional 
list pass on an index value of 1. And here we go. We have a name.

![large](02-068_IMG8.png)

So in review, we created a variable called teams that stores a list. 
The list has multiple nested dictionaries and inside of each one of 
those dictionaries is a key-value pair with more nested collections. In 
order to traverse that we have a number of different ways we can do it 
first, this is the easiest way I think there is to think about it is to 
simply take your data structures when you have nested collections like 
this simply take them one at a time because as you know you have to 
treat each type of data structure differently. You need to use different
 functions on a list then you do a dictionary and so it's important to 
understand that whenever you're trying to query them and that's exactly 
what we did we treated it first like a list where we grabbed that first 
element or you should say the element of the index with the index of 
one.

Then we knew that was a dictionary. So we called get on it and we 
said this is the key that we want and then from there we were able to 
grab all of those values. Turn it into a dictionary view object convert 
that into a list and then we were able to treat that as a plain old 
python list and grab any of the elements we want.

So we were able to if you want to count. We went through 1 level, 2 
levels, 3 levels, and then to get the value 4 different levels in order 
to get the name value that we were looking for. And this is going to be a
 very common practice that you're going to be implementing whenever 
you're working with API. This is very similar to the output you would 
get if for example your querying the Google Maps API. You're going to 
get data that looks very similar to this and you're going to need to 
have the ability to recognize when you're working with a list versus a 
key-value pair dictionary and then convert it, traverse it, and then 
pull out the data that you need.
