## Video lesson Speech

Hi, and welcome to this section of the course where we're going to learn
 how we can automate tasks in the browser using JavaScript.

****

Remember that every `element` in the browser, such as `links`, `headings`, `images`, those are all included in what is called the `DOM` or the `document object model`. Because of that, it means that JavaScript is able to work with every element on the page just like any other object.

That's what the goal of this section the course is going to be is to show you how you can take your JavaScript code and how you can traverse the DOM. We're going to use some great case studies such as LinkedIn, Google, and Instagram for seeing how we can have our own unique JavaScript code that will go through a page and it will perform a task as many times as you need. 

For example, if you want to follow a bunch of people or hashtags on LinkedIn, then you can find the `class` or the `element` on the page that has that button. Then we're going to walk through how you can click all of the elements on the page by just running a single command. There's all kinds of other `automation tasks` that we can use for connecting JavaScript with the browser.
