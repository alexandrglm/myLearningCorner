## 🎯 Popular SQL Implementations

There are **multiple implementations** of SQL. The five main ones cover a broad spectrum of real-world applications.

## 🛠️ MySQL

### Advantages
- **Most popular** - widely used
- **Open-source** - free, no licensing
- **Continuous evolution** - constant updates
- **Stable** - proven maturity

### Disadvantages
- **Enterprise support** - some organisations don't want MySQL installations in their data centres
- **Enterprise limitations** - may not be accepted in corporate circles

## 📧 PostgreSQL (Postgres)

### Characteristics
- **Newer** than MySQL
- **Very popular** in different communities
- **Preferred in Ruby on Rails** - excellent interface with Rails
- **Open-source** - free

### Advanced Functionality
- **Location-based queries** - queries based on location
- **Distance between points** - geographical calculations
- **Latitude/longitude** - specialised data types
- **Available plugins** - extensions for complex cases

## 📋 Oracle SQL Database

### Profile
- **Enterprise environment** - solution for large corporations
- **Not inexpensive** - definitely costly
- **Paid licences** - not open-source

### Enterprise Advantages
- **Incredibly fast** - superior performance
- **Exceptionally well supported** - professional support
- **Constant updates** - active development

## 🎨 MS SQL (Microsoft SQL)

### Context of Use
- **.NET environments** - natural integration
- **Very well supported** - backed by Microsoft
- **Not free** - requires MS SQL licences

### Limitations
- **Small projects** - may not be cost-effective
- **Smaller clients** - not ideal for limited budgets

## 🚀 MariaDB

### Evolution
- **Rapid growth** in popularity
- **Used by Facebook** - and other open-source applications
- **Created by founder of MySQL** - proven experience
- **Modern option** - newer database system

### Considerations
- **Less community support** - being newer
- **Fewer answers** on Stack Overflow
- **Limited documentation** - compared to established options

## 📋 SQL Standardisation

### Standardised Language
SQL is a **standardised language**:
- **MySQL code** → works in other implementations
- **Basic queries** → same syntax everywhere
- **Joins and queries** → universal concepts

### Real Differences
Differences appear in:
- **Advanced functions** - implementation-specific features  
- **Edge cases** - special cases
- **Plugins and extensions** - unique features

### Portability
**Learning one implementation** = knowing all the basics:
- ✅ MySQL → MariaDB
- ✅ MySQL → Oracle  
- ✅ MySQL → MS SQL
- ✅ MySQL → PostgreSQL

## 🎯 For This Course

**Implementation chosen**: **MySQL**
- Fundamentals applicable to all implementations
- Universal standard SQL syntax
- Preparation for any production system
