# Module 3, Part 1:

## Abstract



- Data Structures, Final Part on Tuples.
  
  - Tuples in Dictionaries: Using tuples as dictionary keys.
  
  - Unpacking using tuples/dictionaries, `.zip()`, `.zip(*)`: Data manipulation with `zip()` and `zip(*)` to combine and uncombine iterables.

- Data Structures -> SETS.
  
  - Introduction to Sets (SETs): Properties and basic operations.
  
  - Methods for combining sets: Union, intersection, difference, and more.

- Control Structures:
  
  - Loops:
    
    - Introduction to `while` and `for...in` loops.
    - Implementing loops for lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
    - Iterating over characters in a string.
    - Using `range(start, stop, step)` to iterate over ranges.
    - Loop control with `continue` and `break`.
    - Combining and flattening lists using `.append()`, `.extend()`, and list comprehensions.
    - List comprehensions with conditions: `[x for x in xs if condition]`.
  
  - Conditionals:
    
    - Introduction to conditionals.
    - Using `if`, `elif`, and `else`.
    - Ternary operator: `something if condition else some_other_thing`.
    - Comparison operators: Equality (`==`, `is`), inequality (`!=`, `<>`, `is not`), greater/less than (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`).
    - Membership checking with `in`.
    - Building compound conditionals with `and` and `or`.
  
  - Exercises:
    
    - Removing the first and last element from a list.
    - Implementing FizzBuzz.

- Functions/Methods:
  
  - Basic syntax for creating functions.
  - Using `return` to return values.
  - Nesting functions within parent functions.
  - Default arguments: `(argument = default)`.
  - Named function arguments.
  - Argument unpacking with `*args` and `**kwargs`.
  - Combining `args`, `*args`, and `**kwargs` in a single function.
  - Lambda functions: `lambda argument : expression`.

- Modules and Packages:
  
  - Module importing: Introduction.
  - Creating and importing custom modules.
  - Importing specific functions from a module.
  - Using aliases when importing modules: `import module as alias`.
  - Installing packages with PIP and setting up `pyenv`.
  - Introduction to `numpy` for numerical operations.
  - Using the `requests` module for API communication.
  - Practical exercise: Web scraping with `requests`, `bs4`, and `inflection`.
