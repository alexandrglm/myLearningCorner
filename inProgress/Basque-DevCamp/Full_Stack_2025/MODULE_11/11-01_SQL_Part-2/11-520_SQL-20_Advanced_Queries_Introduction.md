# 11-520 SQL 20 - Advanced Queries Introduction

## CRUD Summary

In the previous section, complete CRUD was covered:
- **Create** (INSERT)
- **Read** (SELECT)
- **Update** (UPDATE)
- **Delete** (DELETE)

## Why Advanced Queries?

The basic CRUD operations are fundamental, but real-world applications require more complex and non-trivial behaviour in queries.

## Topics in This Section

### 1. Subqueries (Subqueries)

- So far you have only executed one query at a time
- Subqueries allow you to execute queries within other queries
- Useful when working with dynamic data
- Scenario: You don't know a specific ID and need to search for it first

### 2. Ranges

- Go beyond hardcoded values
- Set up dynamic ranges
- Search for values within a specific range

### 3. Data Collections

- Create your own data collections
- Search multiple parameters simultaneously
- More flexible than searching for a single value

## Objective

Learn how to implement non-trivial behaviour in queries to handle real-world scenarios where data is dynamic and searches are complex.

## Next Step

Explore each of these concepts in depth with practical code examples.
